In this study, we examined the relationship between mental stress and the activity of reactive oxygen scavenging enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and the effect of the mental stress reduction by makeup on the activity of reactive oxygen scavenging enzymes. In experiment 1, we measured the concentration of cortisol and activity of SOD in saliva after the addition of mental stress. In this result, the concentration of cortisol increased and the activity of SOD decreased significantly. As we examined the effect of makeup following the mental stress addition in experiment 2, the concentration of cortisol decreased and the activity of SOD and CAT increased. Moreover, we showed a decrease in the anxiety state and increase in spiritual health as the psychological effects. Those results suggest that makeup psychologically canceled anxiety and physiologically inhibited the reduction of reactive oxygen scavenging enzyme activity induced by the mental stress.\n",

The patients were seven boys and three girls of ages ranging from 2 to 11 years. The fistula was localized on the left side and was detected by either CT scan or barium roentgenogram. All cases had experienced neck abscess caused by the piriform sinus fistula. Surgical removal of the fistula was performed soon after the infection affecting the fistula had cured. Injection of pyoktanin blue through the opening of the fistula during direct esophagoscopy before surgery made it possible to distinguish the fistula from surrounding tissue without any difficulty. In our review of the ten cases, the thyroid gland of the same side had been removed together with the fistula. The clinical course after surgery was uneventful in all patients.\n",

The physical properties, including electrical impedance, texture, re-hydration rate and micro-structure observation of the samples were observed under a microscope, and changes in L- ascorbic acid were investigated.  The vacuum-microwave drying method was employed based on the finding that it had the least impact on the physical properties and loss of L-ascorbic acid after freezing and after post-thaw rehydration.  The thawing and rehydration process was carried out by immersion in water at 40°C, which inhibited surface hardening and presented the possibility of restoring the semicircular Cole-Cole plot.\n",

This has in turn led to an increase in the number of sites known to have contamination levels in excess of the environmental quality standard (EQS). As a result there is a greater need for a wider variety of techniques to deal with the diverse range of sites identified. Phytoremediation is a strong candidate for certain types of contamination. Phytoremediation, which is defined as the technology using plants to reduce or remove pollution from the environment, has the advantages of low cost and low environmental impact. According to the survey results published in November 2006 by the Ministry of Environment, arsenic and its compounds are identified as the second most common heavy metal that exceeded the EQS. In Japan, phytoremediation of arsenic by using the hyperaccumulator fern (Pteris vittata) has being applied to a number of contaminated sites. However, the process is relatively slow (often taking in excess of one year) and it is not so effective against very high levels of contamination. Thus it is very important to carry out a treatability test at the project planning stage in order to estimate the suitability of the technique for a particular site . In this article, we review about our approaches to establish the arsenic phytoremediation and the outlook of this technology.\n",

In saline-treated and Dex-treated rats, plasma Cort levels were correlated with plasma ACTH levels. In non-treated rats, the time course of EA-induced increase in pain threshold was similar to that of EA-induced elevation of plasma Cort levels. In the hypophysectomized rats, EAA was significantly reduced and the EA-induced increase in plasma Cort was also abolished. Single administration of a large dose of Dex tended to reduce EAA and significantly reduced the EA-induced increase in plasma Cort and ACTH. Further suppression of pituitary functions by 4 days-treatment with Dex resulted in further reduction of EAA and the EA-induced increase in plasma Cort and ACTH. On the other hand, hind-paw pressure test without EA produced an increase in plasma Cort and ACTH to the same extent as that produced by EA and produced no analgesia. In the adrenalectomized rats, EAA was reduced, and the plasma ACTH level, which was sixteen times higher than that of nonoperated rats, was further elevated 2-fold higher by EA. No correlation between plasma ACTH levels and the increase in pain thresholds was observed in individual rats of the saline-treated and Dex-treated groups. Control pain thresholds were not influenced by hypophysectomy, Dex or adrenalectomy. These results suggest that pituitary β-endorphin may not be mainly involved in EAA.\n",

Because it is difficult to measure the average glandular dose received by the breast directly, we calculated conversion factors to obtain the average glandular dose from exposure in air by the following procedures. The method was useful in some specific applications, allowing calculation of the high-accuracy glandular dose. First, we measured X-ray energy spectra from a molybdenum target with a molybdenum filter and from a rhodium target with a rhodium filter at several tube voltages using a high-purity germanium semiconductor radiation detector. We then calculated the exposure per fluence using the X-ray energy spectrum data, and computed the average glandular dose per photon in a semi-elliptical cylindrical breast model using the Monte Carlo method. Finally, we calculated the conversion factors from these numerical data. It was possible to calculate the average glandular dose with exposure in air. We conclude that the X-ray energy spectrum is important for calculating the average glandular dose rather than the half-value layer.\n",

      "Before switching:  Recent studies showed that makeup reduces mental stress, indicated by not only psychological but also physiological values. In this study, we examined the relationship between mental stress and the activity of reactive oxygen scavenging enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and the effect of the mental stress reduction by makeup on the activity of reactive oxygen scavenging enzymes. In experiment 1, we measured the concentration of cortisol and activity of SOD in saliva after the addition of mental stress. In this result, the concentration of cortisol increased and the activity of SOD decreased significantly. As we examined the effect of makeup following the mental stress addition in experiment 2, the concentration of cortisol decreased and the activity of SOD and CAT increased. Moreover, we showed a decrease in the anxiety state and increase in spiritual health as the psychological effects. Those results suggest that makeup psychologically canceled anxiety and physiologically inhibited the reduction of reactive oxygen scavenging enzyme activity induced by the mental stress.\n",

In experiment 1, we measured the concentration of コルチゾン酢酸エステル and 身体活動 of 銅亜鉛スーパーオキシドジスムターゼ in 流涎 after the addition of メンタルストレス. In this result, the concentration of 酢酸コルチゾン アスパラギン酸アミノトランスフェラーゼ増加 and the 運動活動 of スーパーオキサイドディスムターゼ プロトロンビン時間短縮 significantly. As we examined the effect of makeup following the 心的ストレス addition in experiment 2, the concentration of コルチゾン プロトロンビン時間短縮 and the 運動活動 of 銅-亜鉛スーパーオキシドジスムターゼ and ヘムカタラーゼ 血清グルタミン酸オキサロ酢酸トランスアミナーゼ増加. Moreover, we showed a decrease in the 不安感 and アルカリ血症 in 降神術 個別化(オーダーメード医療) as the 心理検査.
