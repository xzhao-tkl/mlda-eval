      "Research Progress on Cytoplasmic Male Sterility in Rice\n",
      "Discoveries in cytoplasmic male sterility have garnered extensive attention from plant breeders. The mechanisms underlying its development are closely linked to the theory of cytoplasmic inheritance. In hybrid rice production, sterile lines play a crucial role in determining the output and planting area of hybrid rice. In fertility restoration research, the primary focus has been on investigating the restoring capability of fertility restoration genes over sterility genes. Previous studies have predominantly focused on investigations involving a single restorer line corresponding to one sterile line. Additionally, some have attempted to use restored hybrid approaches to study the positioning of restoration genes. Different studies have yielded varying conclusions based on the types of interactions and approaches employed. This review provides an overview of the genetics and molecular tagging of CMS types, including the 野败型 (yěbàixìng), 包台型 (bāotáixìng), 滇型 (diān xìng), 红莲型 (hóngliánxìng), and 马协型 (mǎxiéxìng) lines. Furthermore, this paper explores the development and application of molecular biology techniques in the study of CMS in rice. It is hoped that this review will serve as a reference for future research and practical applications of CMS in rice.\n"

      "### **Abstract**\n",
      "\n",
      "In this experiment, sediment and overlying water from Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu were collected. A lake ecosystem simulation device was established in the laboratory while maintaining the integrity of the sediment surface, to investigate the resurgence patterns of cyanobacteria populations in Lake Taihu sediments. After 60 days of light and temperature incubation, the resurgence of cyanobacteria cells was observed under a microscope, and the pigment content in the sediment and overlying water was determined. The results showed that under laboratory simulation conditions, the initial resurgence of cyanobacteria in Lake Taihu sediments primarily existed in small groups of 2-8 cells, with a cell diameter of 7.2-7.8 μm, which is larger than the cell diameter of algae populations during summer (4.8-6 μm). The resurgence process of cyanobacteria in the sediment is closely related to environmental temperature changes. Cyanobacteria began to enter the water column in small quantities when the water temperature reached 14℃ and entered the water in large quantities when the environmental temperature rose to 18-20℃, providing a source for the formation of blooms. The optimal resurgence temperature for cyanobacteria (18-20℃) is higher than that for non-cyanobacteria (14-18℃), indicating that high temperatures are more favorable for cyanobacteria resurgence.\n"
