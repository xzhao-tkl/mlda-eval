Fill-in-the-Blank Query Evaluation\\nA fill-in-the-blank query is **Good** only if **all** conditions hold:\\n- **Faithful reconstruction:** Inserting the `object` into `[BLANK]` reproduces a sentence that keeps the original **meaning and factual correctness**.\\n- **Contextual completeness:** \\n  - The query must contain enough information to answer correctly from the sentence **without needing extra context**. If key qualifiers are missing and make the question ambiguous, mark Poor.\\n  - Avoid overly broad or context-dependent claims that require knowing the surrounding text to interpret.\\n- **Syntactic & semantic clarity:** The prompt must be grammatical and unambiguous when read alone.\\n- **Factual fidelity:** The blank-completed sentence must remain fully true to the original biomedical statement — no extra assumptions, no meaning drift.\\n- **Specificity & self-containment:** \\n  - Filling the blank must be concrete and informative enough to understand the fact without seeing the original given sentence.\\n  - Reject vague placeholders like “these techniques,” “this process,” “it,” “they,” or other context-dependent terms.\\n- Biomedical knowledge requirement: The sentence should express a generalizable biomedical fact\\n  - Reject sentences that only describe a specific case setup, procedural arrangement, or scenario details without encoding a meaningful, general biomedical fact. \\n  - Context-dependent procedural or experimental descriptions are Poor.\\n- **Strict evaluation**: When in doubt, prefer the lower rating (Poor) to avoid overestimating quality.\\n\\n#### 2. Question-Style Paraphrasing Evaluation\\nA paraphrase is Good only if **all** conditions hold:\\n- **Semantic equivalence**: The question asks for exactly the same fact as the fill-in-the-blank sentence (no scope change or reinterpretation).\\n- **Self-containment**: \\n  - The question must be fully understandable on its own without needing the original sentence. It should contain enough detail (subject, relation, qualifiers) to let a reader know what is being asked.\\n  - Mark Poor if the fact is under-specified or unclear outside the original sentence.\\n- **Grammatical and natural:**: Sounds like a real human question; fluent and correct English.\\n- **Biomedical fact focus**: \\n  - Avoid paraphrases that just restate procedural or experimental steps or case scenarios instead of testing biomedical knowledge. \\n  - If the underlying sentence doesn’t encode a meaningful biomedical fact, mark the paraphrase Poor.\\n- **Strict evaluation**: When in doubt, prefer the lower rating (Poor) to avoid overestimating quality.\\n\\n#### 3. Answer and Distractor Quality Evaluation\\nAn answer and distractors are Good only if **all** conditions hold:\\n- **Answer correctness:** The answer must exactly match the blanked phrase from the fill-in-the blank.\\n- **Distractor plausibility:** Each distractor should be a credible, biomedical term or phrase that fits the subject/object and relation but is clearly incorrect.\\n- **Semantic & length consistency:** Distractors should be similar in length and semantic category to the correct answer.\\n- **No trivial negations or absurd options:** Avoid obviously wrong, too generic, or absurd distractors.\\n- **Strict evaluation**: When in doubt, prefer the lower rating (Poor) to avoid overestimating quality.\\n\\n### Additional Practical Checks\\n- **Stand-alone interpretability test (for both triple & fill-in-blank):**\\n  If they cannot confidently restate the intended fact or object because of missing qualifiers or vague references, mark No/Poor.\\n  - If they cannot confidently restate the intended fact or object because of missing qualifiers or vague references, mark No/Poor.\\n- **Error bias guard:**\\n  Prefer No/Poor if there is any ambiguity about whether the fact can stand alone.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"sentence\\\": \\\"<biomedical sentence>\\\",\\n    \\\"triple\\\": {\\n      \\\"subject\\\": \\\"<subject>\\\",\\n      \\\"relation\\\": \\\"<relation>\\\",\\n      \\\"object\\\": \\\"<object>\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"fill_in_blank\\\": \\\"<fill-in-the-blank query>\\\",\\n    \\\"paraphrase\\\": \\\"<question-style paraphrase>\\\",\\n    \\\"answer\\\": \\\"<correct answer>\\\",\\n    \\\"distractors\\\": [\\\"<distractor 1>\\\", \\\"<distractor 2>\\\", \\\"<distractor 3>\\\"]\\n\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Output Format (JSON)\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"explanations\\\": {\\n      \\\"fill_in_blank_quality\\\": \\\"<short explanation>\\\",\\n      \\\"paraphrase_quality\\\": \\\"<short explanation>\\\",\\n      \\\"options_quality\\\": \\\"<short explanation>\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"fill_in_blank_quality\\\": \\\"Good | Poor\\\",\\n    \\\"paraphrase_quality\\\": \\\"Good | Poor\\\",\\n    \\\"options_quality\\\": \\\"Good | Poor\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Input:\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"sentence\\\": \\\"In particular, damage can be drastically accelerated by the intervention of water and some chemicals such as surfactants and salts.\\\",\\n    \\\"triple\\\": {\\n        \\\"subject\\\": \\\"damage\\\",\\n        \\\"relation\\\": \\\"can be drastically accelerated by\\\",\\n        \\\"object\\\": \\\"water and chemicals such as surfactants and salts\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"fill_in_blank\\\": \\\"In particular, damage can be drastically accelerated by the intervention of [BLANK].\\\",\\n    \\\"question\\\": \\\"Which substances can significantly speed up the process of damage according to the statement?\\\",\\n    \\\"answer\\\": \\\"water and chemicals such as surfactants and salts\\\",\\n    \\\"distractors\\\": [\\n        \\\"oxygen and chemicals such as antioxidants and vitamins\\\",\\n        \\\"light and chemicals such as enzymes and hormones\\\",\\n        \\\"heat and chemicals such as acids and bases\\\"\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Output:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"explanations\\\": {\\n    \\\"fill_in_blank_quality\\\": \\\"Poor — Although grammatically fine, the subject is just “damage” without specifying what is being damaged.

    "### Instruction\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a JSON input containing:\n",
    "- A **biomedical sentence**\n",
    "- An associated **knowledge triple** (`subject`, `relation`, `object`)\n",
    "- A **fill-in-the-blank query**\n",
    "- A **question-style paraphrase**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to evaluate each component and return a JSON output with the specified structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Fill-in-the-Blank Query Evaluation\n",
    "A fill-in-the-blank query is **Good** only if **all** conditions hold:\n",
    "- **Faithful reconstruction:** Inserting the `object` into `[BLANK]` reproduces a sentence that keeps the original **meaning and factual correctness**.\n",
    "- **Contextual completeness:** \n",
    "  - The query must contain enough information to answer correctly from the sentence **without needing extra context**. If key qualifiers are missing and make the question ambiguous, mark Poor.\n",
    "  - Avoid overly broad or context-dependent claims that require knowing the surrounding text to interpret.\n",
    "- **Syntactic & semantic clarity:** The prompt must be grammatical and unambiguous when read alone.\n",
    "- **Factual fidelity:** The blank-completed sentence must remain fully true to the original biomedical statement — no extra assumptions, no meaning drift.\n",
    "- **Specificity & self-containment:** \n",
    "  - Filling the blank must be concrete and informative enough to understand the fact without seeing the original given sentence.\n",
    "  - Reject vague placeholders like “these techniques,” “this process,” “it,” “they,” or other context-dependent terms.\n",
    "- Biomedical knowledge requirement: The sentence should express a generalizable biomedical fact\n",
    "  - Reject sentences that only describe a specific case setup, procedural arrangement, or scenario details without encoding a meaningful, general biomedical fact. \n",
    "  - Context-dependent procedural or experimental descriptions are Poor.\n",
    "- **Strict evaluation**: When in doubt, prefer the lower rating (Poor) to avoid overestimating quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Question-Style Paraphrasing Evaluation\n",
    "A paraphrase is Good only if **all** conditions hold:\n",
    "- **Semantic equivalence**: The question asks for exactly the same fact as the fill-in-the-blank sentence (no scope change or reinterpretation).\n",
    "- **Self-containment**: \n",
    "  - The question must be fully understandable on its own without needing the original sentence. It should contain enough detail (subject, relation, qualifiers) to let a reader know what is being asked.\n",
    "  - Mark Poor if the fact is under-specified or unclear outside the original sentence.\n",
    "- **Grammatical and natural:**: Sounds like a real human question; fluent and correct English.\n",
    "- **Biomedical fact focus**: \n",
    "  - Avoid paraphrases that just restate procedural or experimental steps or case scenarios instead of testing biomedical knowledge. \n",
    "  - If the underlying sentence doesn’t encode a meaningful biomedical fact, mark the paraphrase Poor.\n",
    "- **Strict evaluation**: When in doubt, prefer the lower rating (Poor) to avoid overestimating quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Answer and Distractor Quality Evaluation\n",
    "An answer and distractors are Good only if **all** conditions hold:\n",
    "- **Answer correctness:** The answer must exactly match the blanked phrase from the fill-in-the blank.\n",
    "- **Distractor plausibility:** Each distractor should be a credible, biomedical term or phrase that fits the subject/object and relation but is clearly incorrect.\n",
    "- **Semantic & length consistency:** Distractors should be similar in length and semantic category to the correct answer.\n",
    "- **No trivial negations or absurd options:** Avoid obviously wrong, too generic, or absurd distractors.\n",
    "- **Strict evaluation**: When in doubt, prefer the lower rating (Poor) to avoid overestimating quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Practical Checks\n",
    "- **Stand-alone interpretability test (for both triple & fill-in-blank):**\n",
    "  If they cannot confidently restate the intended fact or object because of missing qualifiers or vague references, mark No/Poor.\n",
    "  - If they cannot confidently restate the intended fact or object because of missing qualifiers or vague references, mark No/Poor.\n",
    "- **Error bias guard:**\n",
    "  Prefer No/Poor if there is any ambiguity about whether the fact can stand alone.\n",
