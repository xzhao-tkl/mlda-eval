sentence: Cases of cecum cancer with acute appendicitis are rare, and can often be missed preoperatively.
triple: {'subject': 'Cases of cecum cancer with acute appendicitis', 'relation': 'are rare and can often be missed', 'object': 'preoperatively'}
question: At what stage are cases of cecum cancer with acute appendicitis frequently overlooked due to their rarity?
distractor 1: intraoperatively
distractor 2: postoperatively
distractor 3: during follow-up

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: **intraoperatively**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "Intraoperatively" (during surgery) is a plausible stage where a diagnosis could be missed, especially in the context of rare presentations. In biomedical settings, missed diagnoses can occur intraoperatively due to unexpected findings or atypical presentations. This fits the expected answer type (a stage or time point) and is domain-relevant.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify "preoperatively" (before surgery) as the stage where cases are often missed. "Intraoperatively" is clearly a different stage and is not supported by the original sentence, making it definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: **postoperatively**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "Postoperatively" (after surgery) is also a plausible stage for missed diagnoses, especially if findings are only recognized after the fact. In clinical practice, some conditions are only identified postoperatively, so this fits the context and domain well.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple specify "preoperatively" as the stage where cases are missed. "Postoperatively" is a different time point and is not supported by the original information, making it definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: **during follow-up**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "During follow-up" is somewhat plausible, as missed diagnoses can sometimes be discovered during follow-up visits. However, the original sentence specifically discusses the rarity and missed diagnosis *before* surgery, not during follow-up, so this is less directly plausible than the other two distractors.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state "preoperatively" as the stage where cases are missed. "During follow-up" is a different stage and not supported by the sentence, making it definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| intraoperatively   | 3            | Fits domain, plausible stage for missed diagnosis | 3             | Clearly not "preoperatively" |
| postoperatively    | 3            | Fits domain, plausible stage for missed diagnosis | 3             | Clearly not "preoperatively" |
| during follow-up   | 2            | Somewhat plausible, but less direct than others   | 3             | Clearly not "preoperatively" |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence and triple, as they refer to different stages than "preoperatively." "Intraoperatively" and "postoperatively" are highly plausible in the biomedical context, while "during follow-up" is moderately plausible but less directly relevant to the prompt. All are valid distractors for a multiple-choice question in this context.
