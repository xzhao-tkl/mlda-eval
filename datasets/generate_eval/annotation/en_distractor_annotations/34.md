sentence: The preen glands of swans, ducks and cocks contained a large amount of lipoids, and a small amount of neutral fats.
triple: {'subject': 'The preen glands of swans, ducks and cocks', 'relation': 'contain', 'object': 'a large amount of lipoids and a small amount of neutral fats'}
question: What types and quantities of lipids are found in the preen glands of swans, ducks, and cocks?
distractor 1: a large amount of neutral fats and a small amount of lipoids
distractor 2: only a small amount of lipoids and neutral fats
distractor 3: a large amount of phospholipids and a small amount of cholesterol

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1: "a large amount of neutral fats and a small amount of lipoids"

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** This option is a direct inversion of the quantities in the correct answer. Both "neutral fats" and "lipoids" are plausible lipid types in the context of preen glands. The swap in quantities is subtle and could easily confuse someone, especially since both terms are present in the original sentence.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence clearly states "a large amount of lipoids, and a small amount of neutral fats." This distractor reverses the quantities, making it definitely incorrect according to the provided information.

## Distractor 2: "only a small amount of lipoids and neutral fats"

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** This option is plausible because it mentions the correct lipid types, but it incorrectly states that only small amounts are present, which contradicts the original sentence. The use of "only" and the omission of any large quantity makes it less convincing than distractor 1, but still reasonable.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifies a large amount of lipoids, so saying "only a small amount" is definitely incorrect.

## Distractor 3: "a large amount of phospholipids and a small amount of cholesterol"

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Phospholipids and cholesterol are both types of lipids and could conceivably be found in preen glands, making this option plausible in a general biomedical context. However, the original sentence does not mention these specific lipids, so someone with domain knowledge would recognize the mismatch.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence only mentions lipoids and neutral fats, not phospholipids or cholesterol. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score & Reason) | Incorrectness (Score & Reason) |
|------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | 3: Highly plausible; swaps quantities of correct lipids, very convincing. | 3: Definitely wrong; contradicts the original sentence. |
| 2 | 2: Moderately plausible; correct lipids, but both in small amounts, less convincing. | 3: Definitely wrong; contradicts the specified large amount of lipoids. |
| 3 | 2: Moderately plausible; plausible lipid types, but not mentioned in the sentence. | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by the original sentence. |

---

**Reasoning Summary:**  
All distractors are clearly incorrect, but distractor 1 is the most plausible due to its subtle inversion of quantities. Distractors 2 and 3 are moderately plausible, with 2 being less convincing due to the "only small amount" phrasing, and 3 introducing entirely different lipid types. All are definitely wrong based on the original sentence.
