sentence: Children with submucous cleft palate (S. M. C. P.) and congenital velopharyngeal incompetence (C. V. P. I.) present not only with articulatory problems but also with developmental problems.
triple: {'subject': 'Children with submucous cleft palate (S. M. C. P.) and congenital velopharyngeal incompetence (C. V. P. I.)', 'relation': 'present with', 'object': 'articulatory problems and developmental problems'}
question: Besides articulatory problems, what other issues are observed in children with submucous cleft palate and congenital velopharyngeal incompetence?
distractor 1: respiratory problems
distractor 2: hearing problems
distractor 3: gastrointestinal problems

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: **respiratory problems**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Respiratory problems are somewhat plausible in the context of cleft palate and velopharyngeal incompetence, as these conditions can affect the airway and breathing, especially in severe cases. However, the original sentence does not mention respiratory issues, and they are not the most commonly associated problems compared to speech and developmental issues. Still, a biomedical expert might consider this a reasonable, if not primary, association.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence only mentions "articulatory problems and developmental problems." Respiratory problems are not listed, so this distractor is definitely incorrect as an answer to the prompt.

---

## Distractor 2: **hearing problems**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Hearing problems are a well-known comorbidity in children with cleft palate due to frequent ear infections and Eustachian tube dysfunction. This makes the distractor highly plausible and potentially confusing, as it fits the biomedical context and could be expected by someone familiar with the domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** Despite its plausibility, the original sentence does not mention hearing problems. The only issues listed are articulatory and developmental problems, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: **gastrointestinal problems**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Gastrointestinal problems are not typically associated with cleft palate or velopharyngeal incompetence. While some congenital syndromes may have multiple system involvement, this is not a common or expected association in the context of the prompt. It is easily ruled out by basic biomedical knowledge.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention gastrointestinal problems, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

| Distractor                | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility)                                                                 | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness)                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| respiratory problems      | 2            | Somewhat plausible; possible but not primary association                                 | 3             | Not mentioned in the sentence; definitely incorrect                                      |
| hearing problems          | 3            | Highly plausible; commonly associated comorbidity, fits domain well                      | 3             | Not mentioned in the sentence; definitely incorrect                                      |
| gastrointestinal problems | 1            | Barely plausible; not a typical association, easily ruled out                            | 3             | Not mentioned in the sentence; definitely incorrect                                      |

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are **incorrect** as per the original sentence, scoring 3 for incorrectness.
- **Hearing problems** is the most plausible distractor, likely to confuse even experts.
- **Respiratory problems** is moderately plausible, but less so than hearing problems.
- **Gastrointestinal problems** is barely plausible and easily ruled out.
