sentence: Thyroid surgery is often selected as an introduction to head and neck surgery.
triple: {'subject': 'Thyroid surgery', 'relation': 'is often selected as an introduction to', 'object': 'head and neck surgery'}
question: Which surgical specialty is thyroid surgery commonly used to introduce?
distractor 1: cardiothoracic surgery
distractor 2: neurosurgery
distractor 3: orthopedic surgery

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: cardiothoracic surgery

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Cardiothoracic surgery is a major surgical specialty and shares some anatomical proximity (chest/neck), so a non-expert might plausibly confuse it with head and neck surgery. However, in biomedical education, thyroid surgery is not typically an introduction to cardiothoracic surgery, so someone with basic domain knowledge would rule it out.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that thyroid surgery is used as an introduction to head and neck surgery, not cardiothoracic surgery. There is no ambiguity; this is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: neurosurgery

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Neurosurgery is another specialty involving the head, and a layperson might think thyroid surgery could be related. However, in biomedical training, thyroid surgery is not a typical introduction to neurosurgery, so basic domain knowledge would rule it out.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not support neurosurgery as the correct answer. Thyroid surgery is not used to introduce neurosurgery, so this is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: orthopedic surgery

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Orthopedic surgery is unrelated to the thyroid or head and neck region. Even a layperson would find this connection odd, making it barely plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple make it clear that orthopedic surgery is not the correct answer. There is no ambiguity.

## Summary Table

| Distractor                | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility)                                                                 | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness)                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cardiothoracic surgery    | 2            | Related anatomical region, but not a typical introduction for thyroid surgery.            | 3             | Clearly not supported by the sentence/triple.                                             |
| neurosurgery              | 2            | Involves the head, but not a standard introduction for thyroid surgery.                   | 3             | Clearly not supported by the sentence/triple.                                             |
| orthopedic surgery        | 1            | Unrelated specialty; connection is awkward and implausible.                               | 3             | Clearly not supported by the sentence/triple.                                             |

## Overall Reasoning
- All distractors are clearly incorrect, scoring 3 for incorrectness.
- Cardiothoracic and neurosurgery are moderately plausible due to anatomical proximity or layperson confusion, but not truly plausible for someone with basic biomedical knowledge.
- Orthopedic surgery is barely plausible, as it is unrelated to the context.
