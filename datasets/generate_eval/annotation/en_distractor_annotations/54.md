sentence: The non-proximal (IIa·IIb) type renal tubular cells with a long diameter of 10-25μm showed oval or cubical shapes, and the nuclei were eccentric or central, with bigger N/C ratios than the proximal (I) ones.
triple: {'subject': 'non-proximal (IIa·IIb) type renal tubular cells', 'relation': 'have larger nucleus-to-cytoplasm (N/C) ratios than', 'object': 'proximal (I) type renal tubular cells'}
question: Compared to which type of renal tubular cells do non-proximal (IIa·IIb) cells exhibit larger nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratios?
distractor 1: distal convoluted tubular cells
distractor 2: collecting duct epithelial cells
distractor 3: intercalated cells of the renal tubule

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1: distal convoluted tubular cells

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Reasoning:** "Distal convoluted tubular cells" are a real type of renal tubular cell, and the question is about comparing N/C ratios between types of renal tubular cells. The original sentence specifically contrasts "non-proximal (IIa·IIb)" with "proximal (I)" cells, but "distal convoluted tubular cells" are a plausible alternative because they are a well-known segment of the nephron and could reasonably be considered in such a comparison.
- **Score:** **3** (Highly plausible)

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that the comparison is with "proximal (I) type renal tubular cells," not "distal convoluted tubular cells." Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.
- **Score:** **3** (Definitely wrong)

---

## Distractor 2: collecting duct epithelial cells

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Reasoning:** "Collecting duct epithelial cells" are also a legitimate cell type in the kidney, but they are not typically grouped with "proximal" or "non-proximal" tubular cells in the context of N/C ratio comparisons. However, in a multiple-choice setting, they are plausible enough to be considered as a distractor, though less so than "distal convoluted tubular cells."
- **Score:** **2** (Moderately plausible)

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention collecting duct epithelial cells as the comparison group; it specifically refers to "proximal (I) type renal tubular cells." Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.
- **Score:** **3** (Definitely wrong)

---

## Distractor 3: intercalated cells of the renal tubule

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Reasoning:** "Intercalated cells" are a specialized cell type found in the collecting duct and distal tubule. While they are part of the renal tubule, they are not typically the main comparison group for N/C ratio with "non-proximal (IIa·IIb)" cells. However, they are still plausible as a distractor in a biomedical context.
- **Score:** **2** (Moderately plausible)

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention intercalated cells as the comparison group; the correct answer is "proximal (I) type renal tubular cells." Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.
- **Score:** **3** (Definitely wrong)

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score/Reason) | Incorrectness (Score/Reason) |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| distal convoluted tubular cells | 3 (Highly plausible; fits context well) | 3 (Definitely wrong; not the object in the triple) |
| collecting duct epithelial cells | 2 (Moderately plausible; less direct but still relevant) | 3 (Definitely wrong; not the object in the triple) |
| intercalated cells of the renal tubule | 2 (Moderately plausible; specialized but relevant) | 3 (Definitely wrong; not the object in the triple) |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are **incorrect** because none match the object in the original triple ("proximal (I) type renal tubular cells").
- **Distal convoluted tubular cells** is the most plausible distractor, as it is a common comparison group in renal physiology.
- The other two distractors are moderately plausible, as they are real cell types in the kidney but less likely to be the direct comparison group in this context.

**All distractors are valid and well-chosen for a biomedical multiple-choice question.**
