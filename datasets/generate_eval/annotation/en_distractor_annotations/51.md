sentence: The depletion of stratospheric ozone may lead to increase ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation.
triple: {'subject': 'depletion of stratospheric ozone', 'relation': 'may lead to increased levels of', 'object': 'ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation'}
question: What environmental consequence may result from the depletion of stratospheric ozone?
distractor 1: infrared (IR) radiation
distractor 2: visible light intensity
distractor 3: gamma ray exposure

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1: **infrared (IR) radiation**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Infrared radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation, like UV-B. In the context of atmospheric science, people might associate ozone with blocking various types of radiation, so IR is a plausible distractor. However, domain experts know that ozone depletion specifically affects UV-B, not IR, so it's not highly plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that the consequence is increased UV-B, not IR. There is no support for IR radiation being increased due to ozone depletion.

## Distractor 2: **visible light intensity**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Visible light is another part of the electromagnetic spectrum. While ozone does not significantly affect visible light, a non-expert might think that changes in atmospheric composition could affect overall light intensity. It's plausible but not highly convincing to someone with basic science knowledge.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not support visible light intensity as a consequence of ozone depletion. The correct answer is UV-B radiation.

## Distractor 3: **gamma ray exposure**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Gamma rays are much higher energy than UV-B and are not affected by the ozone layer in Earth's atmosphere. Most people with basic science knowledge would know that ozone depletion does not lead to increased gamma ray exposure, making this distractor less plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention gamma rays, and ozone depletion does not affect gamma ray exposure. This is clearly incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor                | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility)                                                                 | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness)                                               |
|---------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| infrared (IR) radiation   | 2            | Plausible as another type of radiation, but not the one affected by ozone depletion.     | 3             | Clearly not supported by the sentence/triple; not the correct answer.   |
| visible light intensity   | 2            | Plausible as a type of light, but ozone depletion does not affect visible light.         | 3             | Not supported by the sentence/triple; not the correct answer.           |
| gamma ray exposure        | 1            | Barely plausible; ozone does not block gamma rays, so this is a weak distractor.         | 3             | Clearly not supported by the sentence/triple; not the correct answer.   |

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are **incorrect** (score 3) as none are supported by the original sentence/triple.
- **IR radiation** and **visible light intensity** are **moderately plausible** (score 2) because they are types of radiation/light and could confuse non-experts.
- **Gamma ray exposure** is **barely plausible** (score 1) because it is not associated with ozone depletion in any scientific context.

**These distractors are reasonable for a multiple-choice question, with IR and visible light being the strongest distractors for plausibility.**
