sentence: The oxygen affinity of ARC can be modulated to the same level as that of red blood cell (P50=27.0mmHg, OTE=25.0%, n=2.5) by coencapsulating demand amount of pyridoxal-5-phosphate or 2, 3-diphosphoglycerate and chloride ion.
triple: {'subject': 'oxygen affinity of ARC', 'relation': 'can be modulated to the same level as', 'object': 'oxygen affinity of red blood cell (P50=27.0mmHg, OTE=25.0%, n=2.5)'}
question: By coencapsulating pyridoxal-5-phosphate or 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and chloride ion, the oxygen affinity of ARC can be adjusted to match which cell type's oxygen affinity (P50=27.0mmHg, OTE=25.0%, n=2.5)?
distractor 1: platelet
distractor 2: white blood cell
distractor 3: hepatocyte

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: **platelet**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Platelets are a type of blood cell, so in a biomedical context, they are a plausible candidate when discussing cell types in blood. However, platelets are not known for oxygen affinity, as they do not carry hemoglobin. Someone with basic biomedical knowledge would know this, but the distractor is not completely out of place.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly refer to matching the oxygen affinity of red blood cells, which are the only blood cells specialized for oxygen transport. Platelets do not have this property, so this is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: **white blood cell**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** White blood cells are another major blood cell type, so they are plausible in the context of blood cell types. However, like platelets, they do not have a defined oxygen affinity because they do not contain hemoglobin. The distractor fits the domain but is not a strong candidate for oxygen affinity.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence is about matching the oxygen affinity of red blood cells, which is not a property of white blood cells. This is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: **hepatocyte**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Hepatocytes are liver cells, not blood cells. While they are a cell type in the body, they are not involved in oxygen transport or affinity in the context of blood. This distractor is less plausible than the previous two, as it is not a blood cell.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence is about matching the oxygen affinity of red blood cells, and hepatocytes are not involved in this process. This is definitely incorrect.

## **Overall Reasoning**
- **Plausibility:** Platelet and white blood cell are plausible as blood cell types, but not for oxygen affinity. Hepatocyte is less plausible, as it is not a blood cell.
- **Incorrectness:** All distractors are definitely incorrect, as none are the correct cell type for oxygen affinity matching in the context of the sentence.
