sentence: Furthermore, phosphorylation of Akt and ERK was inhibited by RXM and FK228.
triple: {'subject': 'RXM and FK228', 'relation': 'inhibit phosphorylation of', 'object': 'Akt and ERK'}
question: Which proteins have their phosphorylation inhibited by RXM and FK228?
distractor 1: JNK and p38
distractor 2: STAT3 and NF-κB
distractor 3: PI3K and MEK

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: JNK and p38

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** JNK and p38 are both protein kinases involved in signaling pathways similar to Akt and ERK. They are commonly discussed in the same context (MAPK pathways, cell signaling, phosphorylation). An expert could plausibly consider them as possible targets for inhibition by RXM and FK228.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically states that RXM and FK228 inhibit phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, not JNK and p38. There is no mention of JNK or p38 in the sentence or triple, so this distractor is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: STAT3 and NF-κB

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** STAT3 and NF-κB are also signaling proteins involved in phosphorylation events and are relevant in biomedical contexts. However, they are less directly related to Akt and ERK compared to JNK and p38, and are not typically grouped together in the same pathway. Still, they are plausible enough to be considered by someone with general biomedical knowledge.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention STAT3 or NF-κB, and the triple is specific to Akt and ERK. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: PI3K and MEK

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** PI3K and MEK are upstream kinases in the signaling pathways that activate Akt and ERK, respectively. While they are relevant in the same domain and context, the question specifically asks about proteins whose phosphorylation is inhibited, and PI3K and MEK are not typically described as being phosphorylated in the same way as Akt and ERK. This makes them somewhat plausible, but less so than JNK and p38.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention PI3K or MEK, and the inhibition is specific to Akt and ERK. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

| Distractor                | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility)                                                                 | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness)                                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JNK and p38               | 3            | Highly plausible; similar pathway proteins, commonly discussed with Akt/ERK.             | 3             | Definitely wrong; not mentioned in sentence/triple.                            |
| STAT3 and NF-κB           | 2            | Moderately plausible; relevant signaling proteins, but less directly related.             | 3             | Definitely wrong; not mentioned in sentence/triple.                            |
| PI3K and MEK              | 2            | Moderately plausible; upstream kinases, relevant but not typically phosphorylated here.   | 3             | Definitely wrong; not mentioned in sentence/triple.                            |

## Final Reasoning Summary

- **All distractors are clearly incorrect** as per the original sentence and triple.
- **JNK and p38** are the most plausible distractors due to their close relationship to Akt and ERK in signaling pathways.
- **STAT3/NF-κB and PI3K/MEK** are moderately plausible, being relevant proteins but less directly associated with the context of phosphorylation inhibition by RXM and FK228.
