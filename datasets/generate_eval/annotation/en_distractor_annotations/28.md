sentence: Proteome analysis of diseased tissues or cells often provides with information on the molecular features typical of their states.
triple: {'subject': 'Proteome analysis of diseased tissues or cells', 'relation': 'provides information on', 'object': 'molecular features typical of their states'}
question: What type of information is commonly obtained from proteome analysis of diseased tissues or cells?
distractor 1: genetic mutations unrelated to disease state
distractor 2: cellular morphology under normal conditions
distractor 3: metabolic pathways active in healthy tissues

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

### Distractor 1: **genetic mutations unrelated to disease state**

#### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Genetic mutations are a type of molecular information often discussed in biomedical contexts. However, the phrase "unrelated to disease state" makes it less plausible, since the question is about diseased tissues/cells and their specific features. Still, someone unfamiliar with proteomics might consider genetic mutations as a possible answer.

#### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify that proteome analysis provides information on "molecular features typical of their states" (i.e., features *related* to the disease state). Genetic mutations *unrelated* to disease state are not what is obtained from such analysis, making this distractor clearly incorrect.

### Distractor 2: **cellular morphology under normal conditions**

#### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Cellular morphology is a legitimate biological concept, and "normal conditions" is a plausible context. However, proteome analysis is about molecular features, not morphology, and the question is about diseased tissues/cells, not normal ones. Still, the distractor is not completely out of place in biomedical discussions.

#### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple are about molecular features in *diseased* tissues/cells, not about morphology or normal conditions. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

### Distractor 3: **metabolic pathways active in healthy tissues**

#### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Metabolic pathways are a type of molecular feature, and their activity is often studied in biomedical research. However, the focus here is on *diseased* tissues/cells, not healthy ones. The distractor is plausible but not a perfect fit.

#### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple are about features typical of *diseased* states, not healthy ones. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (0-3) | Reason (Plausibility) | Incorrectness (0-3) | Reason (Incorrectness) |
|------------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 1: genetic mutations unrelated to disease state | 2 | Genetic mutations are plausible, but "unrelated to disease state" makes it less fitting. | 3 | Clearly not what proteome analysis of diseased tissues/cells provides. |
| 2: cellular morphology under normal conditions | 2 | Morphology is a biological concept, but not molecular and not about diseased state. | 3 | Not about molecular features or diseased tissues/cells. |
| 3: metabolic pathways active in healthy tissues | 2 | Metabolic pathways are plausible, but focus is on healthy tissues, not diseased. | 3 | Not about diseased tissues/cells, so definitely incorrect. |

## **Overall Assessment**
All distractors are moderately plausible in a biomedical context but are definitely incorrect given the original sentence and triple. They are good distractors for a multiple-choice question, as they are relevant but clearly not the correct answer.
