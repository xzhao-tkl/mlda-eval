sentence: The causative factors of a predisposition to thrombosis include immobility, dehydration, infection, surgery, injury, cancer, pregnancy, and estrogen use.
triple: {'subject': 'predisposition to thrombosis', 'relation': 'is caused by', 'object': 'immobility, dehydration, infection, surgery, injury, cancer, pregnancy, and estrogen use'}
question: Which factors contribute to an increased risk of developing thrombosis?
distractor 1: hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking, alcohol use, and advanced age
distractor 2: autoimmune disease, vitamin deficiency, anemia, asthma, hypothyroidism, and chronic fatigue
distractor 3: high-fiber diet, regular exercise, adequate hydration, low salt intake, and vitamin supplementation

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1:  
**hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, obesity, smoking, alcohol use, and advanced age**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** All listed factors are well-known cardiovascular risk factors and are commonly associated with increased risk of thrombosis in biomedical literature. They fit the expected answer type (risk factors) and could easily confuse even experts, as some overlap with actual risk factors for thrombosis.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 2 (Likely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** While these are plausible risk factors for thrombosis, the original sentence does **not** mention any of them. They are not supported by the given sentence/triple, but some (e.g., obesity, smoking, advanced age) are risk factors for thrombosis in general, so there is some ambiguity. However, based strictly on the sentence, they are not correct.

## Distractor 2:  
**autoimmune disease, vitamin deficiency, anemia, asthma, hypothyroidism, and chronic fatigue**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Some of these (autoimmune disease, anemia) could be considered risk factors for certain conditions, but they are not classic or direct risk factors for thrombosis. The list is somewhat plausible in a biomedical context, but less convincing than Distractor 1.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** None of these factors are mentioned in the original sentence or triple, and most are not established risk factors for thrombosis. The distractor is clearly incorrect based on the provided information.

---

## Distractor 3:  
**high-fiber diet, regular exercise, adequate hydration, low salt intake, and vitamin supplementation**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** These are generally considered protective or healthy lifestyle factors, not risk factors for thrombosis. Their inclusion as "factors contributing to increased risk" is awkward and easily ruled out by common sense and basic biomedical knowledge.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** These are not only absent from the original sentence, but are actually the opposite of risk factors (they are protective). The distractor is clearly incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | 3 | Highly plausible cardiovascular risk factors; fits context well | 2 | Not in sentence, but plausible risk factors in general |
| 2 | 2 | Moderately plausible; some overlap with disease risk, but not classic for thrombosis | 3 | Clearly not mentioned or supported by sentence |
| 3 | 1 | Barely plausible; actually protective factors, not risk factors | 3 | Clearly incorrect, opposite of risk factors |

---

**Overall Reasoning:**  
Distractor 1 is the most plausible and could easily confuse test-takers, but is not supported by the original sentence. Distractor 2 is somewhat plausible but not directly relevant. Distractor 3 is easily ruled out and clearly incorrect. All distractors are incorrect per the original sentence, but their plausibility varies.
