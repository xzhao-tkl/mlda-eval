sentence: The greater the impact of COVID-19 on part-time work and the financial situation of parents, the greater the financial difficulties of the nursing students (p < 0.001).
triple: {'subject': 'Impact of COVID-19 on part-time work and financial situation of parents', 'relation': 'is associated with increased', 'object': 'financial difficulties of nursing students'}
question: What increases among nursing students as the impact of COVID-19 on part-time work and parents' financial situation becomes greater?
distractor 1: academic performance of nursing students
distractor 2: mental resilience of nursing students
distractor 3: employment opportunities for nursing students

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: **academic performance of nursing students**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Academic performance is a common concern in student populations and could be affected by financial stress. However, the sentence specifically links increased impact to increased financial difficulties, not academic performance. Still, someone might plausibly think financial stress could affect grades, making this a moderately plausible distractor.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention academic performance increasing; in fact, if anything, financial difficulties might decrease academic performance. The distractor is clearly not supported by the sentence.

---

## Distractor 2: **mental resilience of nursing students**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Mental resilience is a relevant concept in the context of stress and adversity, which could be linked to financial difficulties. However, the sentence does not mention mental resilience, and typically, increased financial difficulties would not be expected to increase resilience directly. Still, it's a plausible distractor in the biomedical/psychosocial context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not support the idea that mental resilience increases with financial difficulties; if anything, the opposite might be expected. The distractor is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: **employment opportunities for nursing students**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Employment opportunities are related to part-time work and financial situation, so someone might think the impact of COVID-19 could affect job prospects. However, the sentence specifically discusses financial difficulties, not employment opportunities, making this a moderately plausible but not highly convincing distractor.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not state that employment opportunities increase; in fact, the context suggests they might decrease, leading to more financial difficulties. The distractor is clearly incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score/Reason) | Incorrectness (Score/Reason) |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| academic performance | 2: Moderately plausible; related to student outcomes, but not directly supported | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by sentence |
| mental resilience | 2: Moderately plausible; relevant to stress, but not mentioned or expected to increase | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by sentence |
| employment opportunities | 2: Moderately plausible; related to part-time work, but not the focus of the sentence | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by sentence |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are moderately plausible in the biomedical student context, as they relate to common concerns (grades, resilience, jobs). However, none are supported by the original sentence, which only discusses financial difficulties increasing. All are clearly incorrect as answers to the prompt.
