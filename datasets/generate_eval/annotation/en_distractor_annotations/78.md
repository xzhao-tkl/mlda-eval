sentence: One of the worst complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is bile leakage.
triple: {'subject': 'laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC)', 'relation': 'can result in the complication of', 'object': 'bile leakage'}
question: What is considered one of the most serious complications following laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC)?
distractor 1: pancreatitis
distractor 2: intestinal perforation
distractor 3: postoperative hemorrhage

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1: **pancreatitis**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** Pancreatitis is a known and serious complication in abdominal surgeries, including those involving the biliary tract. While not the most common complication of LC, it is plausible and would be believable to someone with biomedical knowledge. It fits the expected answer type (a complication) and is relevant in the surgical context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that "bile leakage" is one of the worst complications after LC. Pancreatitis is not mentioned and is not the correct answer for this specific prompt. It is definitely wrong in this context.

---

## Distractor 2: **intestinal perforation**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** Intestinal perforation is a recognized, though less common, complication of laparoscopic abdominal surgery. It is plausible and relevant in the context of LC, as it is a serious surgical complication that could occur.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify "bile leakage" as the complication. Intestinal perforation is not mentioned and is not the correct answer for this prompt. It is definitely wrong in this context.

---

## Distractor 3: **postoperative hemorrhage**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** Postoperative hemorrhage is a well-known and serious complication of many surgeries, including LC. It is highly plausible and fits the expected answer type and domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify "bile leakage" as the complication. Postoperative hemorrhage is not mentioned and is not the correct answer for this prompt. It is definitely wrong in this context.

| Distractor                | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility)                                                                 | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness)                                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| pancreatitis              | 3            | Known complication, fits context, plausible for LC                                       | 3             | Not the correct answer, not mentioned in the original sentence/triple            |
| intestinal perforation    | 3            | Recognized surgical complication, plausible for LC                                       | 3             | Not the correct answer, not mentioned in the original sentence/triple            |
| postoperative hemorrhage  | 3            | Common surgical complication, highly plausible for LC                                    | 3             | Not the correct answer, not mentioned in the original sentence/triple            |

## **Overall Assessment**
All three distractors are **highly plausible** in the biomedical context and are **definitely incorrect** given the original sentence and triple. They are well-chosen distractors for this multiple-choice question.
