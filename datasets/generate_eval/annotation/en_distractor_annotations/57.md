sentence: The phase shifter using a synchro-resolver as a phase shifting element can serve this purpose, however if its working conditions such as the voltages impressed on two stators and their phase relations are not proper, linearity fails in the relations between the mechanical rotation angle of rotor shaft and the electrical phase-shifting angle of output voltage.
triple: {'subject': 'The phase shifter using a synchro-resolver as a phase shifting element', 'relation': 'fails to maintain linearity between mechanical rotation angle of rotor shaft and electrical phase-shifting angle of output voltage', 'object': 'when the voltages impressed on two stators and their phase relations are not proper'}
question: Under what conditions does a phase shifter using a synchro-resolver fail to maintain linearity between the mechanical rotation angle of the rotor shaft and the electrical phase-shifting angle of output voltage?
distractor 1: the rotor shaft is not properly lubricated
distractor 2: the output voltage is kept constant regardless of input
distractor 3: the stators are connected in parallel instead of series

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

### **Distractor 1: "the rotor shaft is not properly lubricated"**

#### **1) Plausibility in Context**
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** In the context of electromechanical devices, improper lubrication of the rotor shaft could plausibly affect mechanical performance. However, the original sentence is focused on electrical conditions (voltages and phase relations), not mechanical maintenance. While a lack of lubrication could cause mechanical issues, it is not directly relevant to the linearity between rotation angle and phase-shifting angle as described in the prompt. It is plausible in a general engineering context, but less so in the specific context of phase-shifting linearity.

#### **2) Incorrectness**
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence clearly states that linearity fails due to improper voltages and phase relations on the stators, not mechanical issues like lubrication. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect for the specific condition described.

### **Distractor 2: "the output voltage is kept constant regardless of input"**

#### **1) Plausibility in Context**
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** This option references an electrical property (output voltage), which is relevant to the domain. However, the original sentence is about the relationship between mechanical rotation and phase-shifting angle, not about the constancy of output voltage. While keeping output voltage constant could affect system behavior, it is not the specific failure mode described. It is plausible but not highly convincing.

#### **2) Incorrectness**
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention output voltage constancy as a cause for loss of linearity. The failure is attributed to improper stator voltages and phase relations, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

### **Distractor 3: "the stators are connected in parallel instead of series"**

#### **1) Plausibility in Context**
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** This option directly references the stators, which are central to the original sentence. Changing the connection from series to parallel could plausibly affect the voltages and phase relations, making this a convincing distractor that fits the domain and context well.

#### **2) Incorrectness**
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifies that improper voltages and phase relations are the cause, not the connection configuration per se. While the connection could affect those parameters, the distractor is not the specific answer given in the sentence, so it is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score & Reason) | Incorrectness (Score & Reason) |
|------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1. rotor shaft not lubricated | 2: Mechanical issue plausible in general, but not specific to electrical phase-shifting | 3: Not the cause described in the sentence |
| 2. output voltage constant | 2: Electrical property relevant, but not the described failure mode | 3: Not the cause described in the sentence |
| 3. stators in parallel | 3: Highly plausible, directly related to stators and could affect voltages/phase | 3: Not the specific cause described in the sentence |

## **Overall Reasoning**
- **Distractor 3** is the strongest, as it is highly plausible and definitely incorrect.
- **Distractors 1 and 2** are moderately plausible but definitely incorrect.
- All distractors are clearly not the correct answer, but only Distractor 3 could genuinely confuse someone familiar with the domain.
