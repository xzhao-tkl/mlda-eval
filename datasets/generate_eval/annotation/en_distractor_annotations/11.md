sentence: Perineural invasion is one of the significant prognostic factors of pancreatic carcinoma.
triple: {'subject': 'Perineural invasion', 'relation': 'is a significant prognostic factor of', 'object': 'pancreatic carcinoma'}
question: Which factor is considered significant for predicting the prognosis of pancreatic carcinoma?
distractor 1: Lymphatic metastasis
distractor 2: Vascular calcification
distractor 3: Tumor necrosis

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: Plausibility in Context and Incorrectness.

---

## Distractor 1: Lymphatic metastasis

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Lymphatic metastasis is a well-known prognostic factor in many cancers, including pancreatic carcinoma. It fits the expected answer type (a prognostic factor), is relevant to the biomedical domain, and could easily be confused with the correct answer by both laypersons and experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 2 (Likely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically identifies "perineural invasion" as a significant prognostic factor, not lymphatic metastasis. However, lymphatic metastasis is also a recognized prognostic factor in pancreatic carcinoma, so it is not definitively contradicted by the sentence, but it is not the one mentioned.

## Distractor 2: Vascular calcification

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Vascular calcification is less commonly discussed as a prognostic factor for pancreatic carcinoma. While it is a biomedical term and could be considered in the context of disease progression, it is not typically associated with prognosis in this specific cancer, making it moderately plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention vascular calcification as a prognostic factor, and it is not generally recognized as such for pancreatic carcinoma. Therefore, it is clearly incorrect in this context.

## Distractor 3: Tumor necrosis

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Tumor necrosis is a feature that can be associated with poor prognosis in various cancers, including pancreatic carcinoma. It is a plausible distractor, relevant to the domain, and fits the expected answer type.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 2 (Likely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention tumor necrosis as a prognostic factor, but it is a recognized factor in some contexts. Thus, it is likely wrong, but not definitively contradicted by the sentence.

| Lymphatic metastasis | 3            | Well-known prognostic factor, fits context, could confuse experts                       | 2             | Not mentioned in sentence, but is a recognized factor in reality                         |
| Vascular calcification| 2           | Biomedical term, less commonly associated with prognosis in pancreatic carcinoma         | 3             | Not mentioned, not generally recognized as a prognostic factor for this cancer           |
| Tumor necrosis       | 3            | Recognized prognostic factor, fits context, plausible distractor                        | 2             | Not mentioned, but is a recognized factor in some contexts                               |

## Final Reasoning Summary

- **Lymphatic metastasis** and **tumor necrosis** are highly plausible distractors because they are both recognized prognostic factors in cancer, making them convincing options. However, they are not specifically mentioned in the sentence, so they are likely wrong but not definitively contradicted.
- **Vascular calcification** is moderately plausible, as it is a biomedical term but not typically associated with pancreatic carcinoma prognosis. It is definitely wrong in this context, as it is not supported by the sentence or common domain knowledge.
