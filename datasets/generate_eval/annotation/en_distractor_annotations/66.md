sentence: 2) The amount of water sorption increased with an increase in the TMEIC concentration.
triple: {'subject': 'amount of water sorption', 'relation': 'increases with', 'object': 'increase in TMEIC concentration'}
question: An increase in the concentration of which substance leads to greater water sorption?
distractor 1: NaCl concentration
distractor 2: glucose concentration
distractor 3: polymer concentration

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1: NaCl concentration

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** NaCl (sodium chloride) is a common substance in biomedical and chemical contexts. It is plausible that increasing NaCl concentration could affect water sorption, as salt can influence osmotic properties. However, the original sentence specifically mentions TMEIC, which is likely a specialized chemical or polymer, making NaCl less directly relevant but still plausible in a general scientific context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that water sorption increases with TMEIC concentration, not NaCl. There is no mention of NaCl, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Distractor 2: glucose concentration

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Glucose is another common substance in biomedical research. It is plausible that glucose concentration could affect water sorption in some contexts (e.g., hydrogels, biological tissues), but the sentence is about TMEIC, making glucose only moderately plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not mention glucose; the correct answer is TMEIC concentration. Thus, glucose concentration is definitely incorrect.

## Distractor 3: polymer concentration

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "Polymer concentration" is highly plausible in this context. TMEIC is likely a polymer or related chemical, and in many biomedical and material science studies, water sorption is often discussed in relation to polymer concentration. This distractor could easily confuse someone familiar with the domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 2 (Likely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifies TMEIC concentration, not polymer concentration in general. However, if TMEIC is a polymer, there is some ambiguity, as "polymer concentration" could be interpreted as TMEIC concentration. This makes it likely wrong, but not definitely wrong, due to possible overlap in terminology.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor                | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility)                                                                 | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness)                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NaCl concentration        | 2            | Common in biomedical context, plausible but not directly relevant to TMEIC.              | 3             | Not mentioned in sentence/triple, definitely not the answer.                             |
| glucose concentration     | 2            | Common in biomedical context, plausible but not directly relevant to TMEIC.              | 3             | Not mentioned in sentence/triple, definitely not the answer.                             |
| polymer concentration     | 3            | Highly plausible, closely related to TMEIC, could easily confuse domain experts.         | 2             | Likely wrong, but some ambiguity if TMEIC is a polymer; not definitely incorrect.        |

## **Final Reasoning Summary**
- **NaCl and glucose concentrations** are moderately plausible distractors because they are common substances in biomedical contexts, but they are not directly relevant to the specific chemical (TMEIC) mentioned.
- **Polymer concentration** is highly plausible and could easily confuse someone, but it is only likely wrong (not definitely) due to possible overlap with TMEIC if TMEIC is a polymer.
- All distractors are incorrect, but polymer concentration is slightly less clear-cut due to domain ambiguity.
