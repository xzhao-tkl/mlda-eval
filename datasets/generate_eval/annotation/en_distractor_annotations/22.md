sentence: Such multidisciplinary therapies caused the disapperance of not merely the symptoms but also the tumor shadow on esophagograms.
triple: {'subject': 'multidisciplinary therapies', 'relation': 'caused the disappearance of', 'object': 'the tumor shadow on esophagograms'}
question: What did multidisciplinary therapies eliminate in addition to symptoms, as observed on esophagograms?
distractor 1: the inflammation on endoscopic images
distractor 2: the ulceration on gastric radiographs
distractor 3: the lymph node enlargement on CT scans

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

### Distractor 1: **the inflammation on endoscopic images**

#### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "Inflammation on endoscopic images" is a plausible biomedical finding that could be associated with therapies, and endoscopy is a common imaging modality in GI medicine. However, the original sentence specifically refers to "tumor shadow on esophagograms," which is a radiographic finding, not endoscopic. The distractor is somewhat plausible but less so because it shifts both the imaging modality and the pathology.

#### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that the disappearance was of the "tumor shadow on esophagograms," not inflammation on endoscopic images. There is no mention of inflammation or endoscopy, so this is definitely incorrect.

### Distractor 2: **the ulceration on gastric radiographs**

#### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "Ulceration on gastric radiographs" is a plausible finding in GI radiology and could be a target of therapy. However, the original sentence is about "tumor shadow" and "esophagograms" (which are specific to the esophagus, not the stomach). The distractor is plausible in a general GI context but less so for this specific scenario.

#### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention ulceration or gastric radiographs. The disappearance was of a tumor shadow on esophagograms, so this is definitely incorrect.

---

### Distractor 3: **the lymph node enlargement on CT scans**

#### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "Lymph node enlargement on CT scans" is a plausible finding in oncology and could be affected by therapies. However, the original sentence is about esophagograms (a specific imaging modality for the esophagus) and tumor shadow, not lymph nodes or CT scans. The distractor is plausible in a broad cancer context but not specific to the scenario described.

#### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention lymph node enlargement or CT scans. The disappearance was of a tumor shadow on esophagograms, so this is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score/Reason) | Incorrectness (Score/Reason) |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1. the inflammation on endoscopic images | 2: plausible in GI context, but not specific to esophagograms/tumor shadow | 3: definitely not mentioned in the sentence/triple |
| 2. the ulceration on gastric radiographs | 2: plausible in GI radiology, but not specific to esophagograms/tumor shadow | 3: definitely not mentioned in the sentence/triple |
| 3. the lymph node enlargement on CT scans | 2: plausible in oncology, but not specific to esophagograms/tumor shadow | 3: definitely not mentioned in the sentence/triple |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are moderately plausible in a general biomedical context, as they refer to findings that could be affected by therapies and are relevant to imaging. However, each distractor shifts either the imaging modality, anatomical site, or pathology away from what is described in the original sentence and triple. All are definitely incorrect as answers to the specific question, as none are supported by the original sentence or triple.
