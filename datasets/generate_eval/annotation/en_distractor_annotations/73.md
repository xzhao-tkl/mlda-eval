sentence: Electroneurography (ENoG) values are used to assess the prognosis of facial nerve palsy.
triple: {'subject': 'Electroneurography (ENoG) values', 'relation': 'are used to assess', 'object': 'the prognosis of facial nerve palsy'}
question: Which values are utilized to evaluate the prognosis of facial nerve palsy?
distractor 1: Electromyography (EMG) readings
distractor 2: Computed tomography (CT) scans
distractor 3: Serum antibody titers

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: Electromyography (EMG) readings

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** EMG is a neurophysiological test, closely related to ENoG, and is often used in the assessment of nerve and muscle function. In the context of facial nerve palsy, EMG readings could plausibly be considered for prognosis, making this a very convincing distractor for both laypersons and experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically states ENoG values are used, not EMG readings. While EMG is related, it is not the answer given in the sentence/triple, so it is definitely incorrect in this context.

---

## Distractor 2: Computed tomography (CT) scans

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** CT scans are used in medical diagnostics, including for neurological conditions, but they are imaging studies, not "values" in the sense of neurophysiological measurements. While CT scans might be used to rule out structural causes of facial nerve palsy, they are not typically used to assess prognosis via "values." Still, the distractor is plausible enough to be considered by someone with less domain knowledge.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple clearly refer to neurophysiological values, not imaging studies. CT scans do not provide the type of data referenced, so this is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: Serum antibody titers

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Serum antibody titers are laboratory values, but they are not typically associated with the prognosis of facial nerve palsy. Their use is more relevant in infectious or autoimmune disease contexts. This distractor is easily ruled out by anyone with basic biomedical knowledge.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention anything about immunological or serological testing. Serum antibody titers are not used to assess the prognosis of facial nerve palsy, so this is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| EMG readings | 3 | Closely related neurophysiological test; plausible in context | 3 | Not the answer given in the sentence/triple |
| CT scans | 2 | Medical diagnostic tool, but not a "value" for prognosis | 3 | Not neurophysiological values; definitely incorrect |
| Serum antibody titers | 1 | Lab value, but not relevant to facial nerve palsy prognosis | 3 | Not used for prognosis in this context |

**Overall, the distractors are well-chosen, with EMG readings being the strongest and most plausible, CT scans moderately plausible, and serum antibody titers the weakest but still clearly incorrect.**
