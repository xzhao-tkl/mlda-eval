sentence: The presence of the νc-o band at 1624-4590cm-1 indicated predominance of the enol form over, keto form in the solid or neat liquid state.
triple: {'subject': 'presence of the νc-o band at 1624-4590cm-1', 'relation': 'indicates predominance of', 'object': 'enol form over keto form in the solid or neat liquid state'}
question: Which tautomeric form is predominant in the solid or neat liquid state as indicated by the νc-o band at 1624-4590cm-1?
distractor 1: keto form over enol form
distractor 2: equal amounts of enol and keto forms
distractor 3: hydrated form over enol form

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: **keto form over enol form**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The question is about tautomeric forms (enol vs. keto), and this distractor simply reverses the correct answer. In the context of tautomerism, "keto form over enol form" is a very plausible answer and could easily confuse even experts, as both forms are commonly discussed in chemistry and biochemistry.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The original sentence explicitly states that the enol form predominates over the keto form. This distractor is the direct opposite, making it clearly incorrect based on the provided information.

---

## Distractor 2: **equal amounts of enol and keto forms**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  Suggesting equal amounts is a reasonable alternative in tautomeric equilibrium scenarios. While not as strong as the direct reversal, it fits the domain and context, but can be ruled out by the explicit statement in the sentence about predominance.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The sentence does not support equal amounts; it clearly states predominance of one form over the other. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: **hydrated form over enol form**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  "Hydrated form" is a possible chemical species, but the question and sentence are specifically about tautomeric forms (enol and keto). While a hydrated form can exist, it is less directly relevant and plausible than the other options, but still not completely out of place in a chemical context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The sentence only discusses enol and keto forms, not hydrated forms. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect for the specific context.

| Distractor                        | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility)                                                                 | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness)                                                      |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| keto form over enol form          | 3            | Direct reversal; fits context perfectly; could confuse experts.                          | 3             | Explicitly contradicted by the sentence.                                      |
| equal amounts of enol and keto    | 2            | Reasonable alternative; fits domain; can be ruled out by sentence.                       | 3             | Sentence states predominance, not equality.                                   |
| hydrated form over enol form      | 2            | Less relevant but possible in chemistry; not the main focus of the question.             | 3             | Sentence only discusses enol/keto, not hydrated forms.                        |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the sentence, but vary in plausibility. The first is the most plausible, the second and third are moderately plausible but less so due to context specificity. All are valid distractors for a biomedical/chemical multiple-choice question.
