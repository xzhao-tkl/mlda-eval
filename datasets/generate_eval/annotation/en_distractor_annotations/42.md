sentence: Clinical use of CD34+ cells positively selected from cryopreserved peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) has been limited, and there have been only a few reports of this procedure, mainly because clump formation decreases the proportion of CD34+ cells that can be recovered.
triple: {'subject': 'clump formation during processing of cryopreserved peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC)', 'relation': 'decreases the proportion of', 'object': 'CD34+ cells that can be recovered'}
question: What factor limits the recovery of CD34+ cells from cryopreserved peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) by decreasing their proportion?
distractor 1: cell apoptosis
distractor 2: bacterial contamination
distractor 3: insufficient thawing

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: **cell apoptosis**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Cell apoptosis (programmed cell death) is a well-known biological process that can reduce cell numbers during processing of stem cells. In the context of recovering CD34+ cells from PBSC, apoptosis is a plausible factor that could decrease the proportion of viable cells. It fits the biomedical domain and the expected answer type.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically states that "clump formation" is the limiting factor, not apoptosis. There is no mention of apoptosis in the sentence or triple, so this distractor is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: **bacterial contamination**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Bacterial contamination is a general concern in cell processing and could theoretically affect cell recovery. However, it is less directly related to the specific process described (cryopreserved PBSC and CD34+ cell recovery) compared to apoptosis or clump formation. It fits the domain but is not as tightly connected to the context.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not mention bacterial contamination as a factor. The only limiting factor described is clump formation, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: **insufficient thawing**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Insufficient thawing is a technical issue that can occur during the processing of cryopreserved cells and could plausibly decrease the recovery of viable CD34+ cells. It is a convincing distractor in this context and fits the expected answer type.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention thawing as a limiting factor. The only factor described is clump formation, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

| Distractor                | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility)                                                                 | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness)                                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cell apoptosis            | 3            | Fits domain and context; plausible biological cause for decreased cell recovery.          | 3             | Not mentioned in sentence/triple; clearly not the correct answer.              |
| bacterial contamination   | 2            | General concern in cell processing; less directly related to context.                     | 3             | Not mentioned in sentence/triple; clearly not the correct answer.              |
| insufficient thawing      | 3            | Technical issue plausible in cryopreserved cell processing; fits context well.            | 3             | Not mentioned in sentence/triple; clearly not the correct answer.              |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence and triple, which only mention clump formation as the limiting factor. "Cell apoptosis" and "insufficient thawing" are highly plausible distractors in this biomedical context, while "bacterial contamination" is moderately plausible but less directly related. All are suitable distractors for a multiple-choice question in this domain.
