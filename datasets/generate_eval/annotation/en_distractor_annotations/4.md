sentence: The advantages of 201TlCl are as follows: (1) 201TlCl does not accumulate in bones.
triple: {'subject': '201TlCl', 'relation': 'does not accumulate in', 'object': 'bones'}
question: In which tissue does 201TlCl fail to accumulate?
distractor 1: liver
distractor 2: kidneys
distractor 3: lungs

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: Plausibility in Context and Incorrectness.

---

## Distractor 1: **liver**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The liver is a common tissue/organ referenced in biomedical imaging and pharmacokinetics. It is plausible that a radiotracer like 201TlCl could be discussed in terms of its accumulation in the liver. The distractor fits the expected answer type (tissue/organ) and is domain-relevant.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically states that 201TlCl does **not** accumulate in bones. There is no mention of the liver, so "liver" is definitely incorrect as the answer to the question "In which tissue does 201TlCl fail to accumulate?" based on the provided information.

## Distractor 2: **kidneys**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** Kidneys are another major organ often discussed in the context of radiotracer distribution and biomedical imaging. It is plausible and fits the domain and context well.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence only states that 201TlCl does not accumulate in bones. There is no information about the kidneys, so "kidneys" is definitely incorrect for the specific question.

---

## Distractor 3: **lungs**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** Lungs are a plausible tissue for this context, as they are commonly referenced in biomedical imaging and radiotracer studies. The distractor fits the expected answer type and domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence only excludes bones. There is no mention of lungs, so "lungs" is definitely incorrect for the question.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| liver      | 3            | Common organ, fits context and domain | 3            | Not mentioned, definitely incorrect |
| kidneys    | 3            | Common organ, fits context and domain | 3            | Not mentioned, definitely incorrect |
| lungs      | 3            | Common organ, fits context and domain | 3            | Not mentioned, definitely incorrect |

## **Overall Assessment**
All three distractors are highly plausible in the biomedical context and are definitely incorrect based on the original sentence and triple. They are well-constructed distractors for this multiple-choice question.
