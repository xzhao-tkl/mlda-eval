sentence: Thus, surfactants bearing a benzene ring can be more easily decomposed than those with only an alkyl group.
triple: {'subject': 'surfactants bearing a benzene ring', 'relation': 'can be more easily decomposed than', 'object': 'surfactants containing only an alkyl group'}
question: Compared to which type of surfactants are those with a benzene ring more readily decomposed?
distractor 1: surfactants containing a carboxyl group
distractor 2: surfactants with a phosphate group
distractor 3: surfactants bearing a nitro group

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: **surfactants containing a carboxyl group**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Carboxyl groups are common functional groups in surfactant chemistry. The distractor fits the expected answer type (a type of surfactant defined by a functional group), and is plausible in the context of comparing decomposition rates. However, the original sentence specifically contrasts benzene rings with alkyl groups, not carboxyl groups, so an expert would recognize this as not the intended comparison, but it is still a reasonable distractor.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state the comparison is with surfactants containing only an alkyl group, not a carboxyl group. This distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Distractor 2: **surfactants with a phosphate group**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Phosphate groups are also common in surfactant chemistry and environmental discussions. This distractor fits the expected answer type and is plausible in the context of decomposition comparisons. However, it is not the group mentioned in the original sentence, so while plausible, it is not highly confusing for experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention phosphate groups; the comparison is with alkyl groups. This distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: **surfactants bearing a nitro group**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Nitro groups are less common in surfactants but are still a recognizable chemical group. The distractor fits the expected answer type and is plausible in the context of chemical decomposition, though less so than carboxyl or phosphate. It is not awkward or nonsensical, but not highly plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention nitro groups; the comparison is with alkyl groups. This distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Carboxyl   | 2            | Common group, plausible comparison, not the original | 3            | Not mentioned, clearly not the answer |
| Phosphate  | 2            | Common group, plausible, not the original | 3            | Not mentioned, clearly not the answer |
| Nitro      | 2            | Recognizable group, plausible, less common | 3            | Not mentioned, clearly not the answer |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are moderately plausible—they fit the expected answer type and are reasonable in the context of surfactant chemistry, though none are highly confusing for experts. All are definitely incorrect, as none match the original object ("surfactants containing only an alkyl group") specified in the sentence and triple. The distractors are well-constructed for a biomedical multiple-choice setting.
