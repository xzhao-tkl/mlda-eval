sentence: The concentration of Mg increased with the elevation.
triple: {'subject': 'concentration of Mg', 'relation': 'increases with', 'object': 'elevation'}
question: With which environmental factor does the concentration of magnesium increase?
distractor 1: temperature
distractor 2: humidity
distractor 3: soil pH

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: Plausibility in Context and Incorrectness.

---

## Distractor 1: **temperature**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Temperature is a common environmental factor discussed in relation to plant or soil chemistry in biomedical and ecological contexts. It is plausible that someone might think magnesium concentration could increase with temperature, even though the sentence specifies "elevation." The distractor fits the expected answer type and domain, but is not as closely related as "elevation."

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that magnesium concentration increases with elevation, not temperature. There is no ambiguity; temperature is not supported by the sentence.

## Distractor 2: **humidity**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Humidity is another environmental factor often considered in studies of mineral concentration in plants or soils. It is plausible in the domain and context, though not as directly related to the sentence as "elevation." It could be considered by someone unfamiliar with the specific sentence.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not mention humidity; the only factor mentioned is elevation. Humidity is clearly incorrect as the answer.

## Distractor 3: **soil pH**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Soil pH is a very common factor affecting mineral concentrations in soils and plants, especially in biomedical and ecological studies. It is highly plausible as a distractor and could easily confuse even experts, as it is often studied alongside elevation.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple specify "elevation" as the factor, not soil pH. There is no ambiguity; soil pH is not supported by the sentence.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor   | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| temperature  | 2            | Common environmental factor, plausible but less direct than elevation | 3             | Not mentioned, clearly not the answer |
| humidity     | 2            | Plausible in domain, but not directly related to sentence | 3             | Not mentioned, clearly not the answer |
| soil pH      | 3            | Highly plausible, commonly associated with mineral concentration | 3             | Not mentioned, clearly not the answer |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence and triple, earning a score of 3 for Incorrectness. For Plausibility, "soil pH" is the most convincing distractor, as it is highly relevant in the domain and could easily be mistaken for the correct answer. "Temperature" and "humidity" are moderately plausible, as they are common environmental factors but less directly associated with magnesium concentration than "elevation" or "soil pH." None of the distractors are implausible or irrelevant.
