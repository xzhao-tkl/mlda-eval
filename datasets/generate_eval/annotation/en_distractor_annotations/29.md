sentence: The hydrolysis of the o-isomer at elevated temperatures proceeded smoothly to afford disodium phthalate in a good yield.
triple: {'subject': 'Hydrolysis of the o-isomer at elevated temperatures', 'relation': 'produces', 'object': 'disodium phthalate in a good yield'}
question: What compound is obtained in good yield from the hydrolysis of the o-isomer at elevated temperatures?
distractor 1: monosodium phthalate in a poor yield
distractor 2: potassium phthalate in a moderate yield
distractor 3: sodium benzoate in a good yield

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: **monosodium phthalate in a poor yield**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Monosodium phthalate is chemically related to disodium phthalate (the correct answer), and could plausibly be a product of hydrolysis, especially if incomplete neutralization occurs. The "poor yield" makes it less plausible, since the sentence specifies a "good yield," but the distractor is still reasonable in the context of chemical reactions.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence clearly states "disodium phthalate in a good yield" is produced, not monosodium phthalate, and not in poor yield. This is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: **potassium phthalate in a moderate yield**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Potassium phthalate is a plausible alternative product in a similar chemical context, as potassium can substitute for sodium in salts. "Moderate yield" is less convincing than "good yield," but the distractor fits the domain and context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence specifies "disodium phthalate" and does not mention potassium phthalate. The yield is also different. This is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: **sodium benzoate in a good yield**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Sodium benzoate is a common chemical, but it is not directly related to phthalate chemistry. However, it is a plausible distractor for someone not paying close attention to the specific reaction described. The "good yield" matches the original, which increases plausibility, but the compound is less closely related than the other distractors.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence is about phthalate formation, not benzoate. Sodium benzoate is not produced in this reaction, so this is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score/Reason) | Incorrectness (Score/Reason) |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| monosodium phthalate in a poor yield | 2: Related compound, plausible but yield is off | 3: Clearly not the product described |
| potassium phthalate in a moderate yield | 2: Similar salt, plausible but not mentioned | 3: Not the product, yield is different |
| sodium benzoate in a good yield | 2: Common chemical, plausible but less related | 3: Not the product, unrelated to reaction |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are moderately plausible—they are chemically reasonable and fit the context, though none are as close as the correct answer. All are definitely incorrect based on the original sentence and triple. The distractors are well-constructed for a biomedical/chemical multiple-choice setting.
