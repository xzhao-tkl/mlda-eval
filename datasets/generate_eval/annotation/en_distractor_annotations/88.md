sentence: These results suggest that screening for colorectal cancer is effective for people 40-79 years of age but not for those aged 80 years and older.
triple: {'subject': 'screening for colorectal cancer', 'relation': 'is effective for', 'object': 'people 40-79 years of age'}
question: For which age group is colorectal cancer screening considered effective according to the results?
distractor 1: people under 40 years of age
distractor 2: people 80 years and older
distractor 3: people 50-89 years of age

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: **people under 40 years of age**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score:** 2
- **Reasoning:** This is a plausible distractor because age is the key variable in the sentence, and "under 40" is a common age group considered in screening guidelines. It fits the biomedical context and could be a reasonable guess for someone unfamiliar with the specifics. However, it's less plausible than the correct range (40-79), and most experts would know that screening is rarely recommended for those under 40.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score:** 3
- **Reasoning:** The sentence explicitly states effectiveness for 40-79, not under 40. There is no support for effectiveness in this group, so this is definitely wrong.

---

## Distractor 2: **people 80 years and older**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score:** 3
- **Reasoning:** This is highly plausible because the sentence directly contrasts 40-79 with 80 and older, making this a very tempting distractor. It fits the context and domain perfectly and could easily confuse someone not reading carefully.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score:** 3
- **Reasoning:** The sentence specifically says screening is *not* effective for those 80 and older, so this is definitely wrong.

---

## Distractor 3: **people 50-89 years of age**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score:** 3
- **Reasoning:** This is highly plausible because it overlaps with the correct range (40-79) and extends it, which is a common distractor strategy. It sounds reasonable and fits the biomedical context, potentially confusing test-takers who don't pay close attention to the exact age range.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score:** 2
- **Reasoning:** This is likely wrong because the sentence only supports effectiveness for 40-79, not up to 89. However, since 50-79 is within the effective range, there is some ambiguity for the 50-79 portion, but the inclusion of 80-89 makes it incorrect overall.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score, Reason) | Incorrectness (Score, Reason) |
|------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| people under 40 years of age | 2: plausible age group, but less likely | 3: definitely not supported by sentence |
| people 80 years and older    | 3: highly plausible, directly contrasted | 3: explicitly stated as not effective |
| people 50-89 years of age    | 3: very plausible, overlaps with correct range | 2: likely wrong, but partially overlaps with correct range |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are relevant and plausible in the biomedical context, with distractors 2 and 3 being especially strong due to their close relationship to the correct answer. All are clearly incorrect, though distractor 3 is slightly less clear-cut due to partial overlap with the effective age range.
