sentence: Conventional methods for biomass gasification to hydrogen and synthesis gas are carried out at high temperature (1073-1673 K).
triple: {'subject': 'Conventional methods for biomass gasification to hydrogen and synthesis gas', 'relation': 'are performed at', 'object': 'high temperature (1073-1673 K)'}
question: At what temperature range are conventional biomass gasification methods to produce hydrogen and synthesis gas typically conducted?
distractor 1: low temperature (273-373 K)
distractor 2: moderate temperature (473-673 K)
distractor 3: ultra-high temperature (1873-2073 K)

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1: **low temperature (273-373 K)**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 1**
- **Reasoning:** In the biomedical/chemical engineering context, "low temperature (273-373 K)" is not plausible for biomass gasification, which is known to require much higher temperatures. Even without deep domain knowledge, most would recognize that gasification is a high-temperature process, making this distractor easily ruled out.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The distractor is definitely wrong. The original sentence explicitly states the process occurs at "high temperature (1073-1673 K)", so "low temperature (273-373 K)" is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: **moderate temperature (473-673 K)**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2**
- **Reasoning:** "Moderate temperature (473-673 K)" is somewhat plausible. While still much lower than the stated range, someone unfamiliar with the specifics of gasification might consider it possible. It fits the expected answer type and is not obviously nonsensical.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The distractor is definitely wrong. The original sentence specifies "high temperature (1073-1673 K)", so "moderate temperature (473-673 K)" does not match and is incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: **ultra-high temperature (1873-2073 K)**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** "Ultra-high temperature (1873-2073 K)" is highly plausible. It fits the context of gasification (a high-temperature process) and could easily confuse someone, as it is a temperature range even higher than the correct answer. It is a convincing distractor for experts and non-experts alike.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The distractor is definitely wrong. The original sentence gives a specific range ("1073-1673 K"), and "ultra-high temperature (1873-2073 K)" is outside this range, making it clearly incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (0-3) | Reasoning | Incorrectness (0-3) | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| low temperature (273-373 K) | 1 | Easily ruled out; not plausible for gasification | 3 | Clearly not the correct range |
| moderate temperature (473-673 K) | 2 | Somewhat plausible; fits answer type but not the process | 3 | Clearly not the correct range |
| ultra-high temperature (1873-2073 K) | 3 | Highly plausible; fits context and could confuse | 3 | Clearly outside the correct range |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are **incorrect** (score 3) as none match the original sentence's specified temperature range.
- Plausibility varies: "ultra-high temperature" is the best distractor, "moderate temperature" is decent, and "low temperature" is weak.
- The set covers a good range of plausibility, with at least one highly plausible distractor.
