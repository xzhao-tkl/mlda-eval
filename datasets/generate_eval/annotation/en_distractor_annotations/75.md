sentence: Therefore, it is probable that the fluoride has no serious effect on thyroid metabolism.
triple: {'subject': 'fluoride', 'relation': 'has no serious effect on', 'object': 'thyroid metabolism'}
question: According to the statement, which metabolic process is not seriously affected by fluoride?
distractor 1: glucose metabolism
distractor 2: calcium metabolism
distractor 3: lipid metabolism

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: Plausibility in Context and Incorrectness.

---

## Distractor 1: glucose metabolism

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** Glucose metabolism is a well-known metabolic process in biomedical contexts. The question asks about a metabolic process not seriously affected by fluoride, and glucose metabolism is a plausible candidate. It fits the expected answer type and domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify "thyroid metabolism" as the process not seriously affected by fluoride. There is no mention of glucose metabolism, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Distractor 2: calcium metabolism

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** Calcium metabolism is another major metabolic process relevant in biomedical discussions. It is plausible as an answer to the question, as it fits the context and domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not mention calcium metabolism. The only process specified is thyroid metabolism, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Distractor 3: lipid metabolism

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** Lipid metabolism is a common metabolic process discussed in biomedical contexts. It is plausible as a distractor for the question, fitting the expected answer type and domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention lipid metabolism. The only process specified is thyroid metabolism, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility)                                   | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness)                                   |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| glucose metabolism | 3            | Common metabolic process, fits context and domain well     | 3             | Not mentioned in sentence/triple, definitely incorrect       |
| calcium metabolism | 3            | Relevant metabolic process, plausible in biomedical context| 3             | Not mentioned in sentence/triple, definitely incorrect       |
| lipid metabolism   | 3            | Fits expected answer type, plausible in biomedical context | 3             | Not mentioned in sentence/triple, definitely incorrect       |

## Overall Reasoning

All three distractors are highly plausible as answers to the question, as they are well-known metabolic processes and fit the biomedical context. None of them are mentioned or implied in the original sentence or triple, making them definitely incorrect. These distractors are well-constructed for a multiple-choice setting.
