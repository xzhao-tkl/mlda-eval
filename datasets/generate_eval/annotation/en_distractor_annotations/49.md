sentence: 2. The mineral substances found spectrographically in the various organs and tissues were Na, K, Mg, Ca, P, Si, Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, Al, Ti, V, Ag, Sr, Sn, Pb, Ni and B.
triple: {'subject': 'mineral substances found spectrographically in various organs and tissues', 'relation': 'include', 'object': 'Na, K, Mg, Ca, P, Si, Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, Al, Ti, V, Ag, Sr, Sn, Pb, Ni and B'}
question: Which mineral elements were identified spectrographically in various organs and tissues?
distractor 1: Na, K, Mg, Ca, S, Cl, Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, Al, Ti, V, Ag, Sr, Sn, Pb, Ni and B
distractor 2: Na, K, Mg, Ca, P, Si, Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, Al, Ti, V, Ag, Sr, Sn, Pb, Co and B
distractor 3: Na, K, Mg, Ca, P, Si, Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, Al, Ti, V, Ag, Sr, Sn, Pb, Ni and Se

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1:  
**Na, K, Mg, Ca, S, Cl, Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, Al, Ti, V, Ag, Sr, Sn, Pb, Ni and B**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  This list is very similar to the original, with only two substitutions: S (sulfur) and Cl (chlorine) are present instead of P (phosphorus) and Si (silicon). Both S and Cl are common mineral elements found in biological tissues, making this distractor highly plausible and likely to confuse even experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The distractor is definitely incorrect because it does not match the original list from the sentence. The original sentence specifically lists P and Si, not S and Cl. Thus, this option is not supported by the sentence.

## Distractor 2:  
**Na, K, Mg, Ca, P, Si, Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, Al, Ti, V, Ag, Sr, Sn, Pb, Co and B**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  This list is almost identical to the original, except that Ni (nickel) is replaced by Co (cobalt). Cobalt is a plausible mineral element in biomedical contexts and could easily be mistaken for nickel in such a list, making this distractor highly plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The distractor is definitely incorrect because the original sentence lists Ni, not Co. The substitution makes this option not supported by the original sentence.

---

## Distractor 3:  
**Na, K, Mg, Ca, P, Si, Cu, Mn, Zn, Fe, Al, Ti, V, Ag, Sr, Sn, Pb, Ni and Se**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  This list is identical to the original except for the last element: Se (selenium) instead of B (boron). Selenium is a well-known trace element in biology, making this distractor highly plausible and likely to confuse experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The distractor is definitely incorrect because the original sentence lists B, not Se. The substitution makes this option not supported by the original sentence.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score/Reason) | Incorrectness (Score/Reason) |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | 3: Highly plausible; common mineral elements substituted | 3: Definitely wrong; does not match original list |
| 2 | 3: Highly plausible; plausible element substituted | 3: Definitely wrong; does not match original list |
| 3 | 3: Highly plausible; plausible element substituted | 3: Definitely wrong; does not match original list |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
All three distractors are highly plausible in the biomedical context, as they substitute elements that are commonly found in biological tissues and could easily be mistaken for those in the original list. Each distractor is definitely incorrect because it does not match the original sentence's list of mineral substances. These distractors are well-designed for challenging multiple-choice questions in biomedical education.
