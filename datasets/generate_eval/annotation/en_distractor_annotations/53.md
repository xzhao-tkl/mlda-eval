sentence: Mastectomy was once the standard surgical procedure for breast cancer, but several surgical methods, such as breast conserving surgery, sentinel node biopsy, and breast reconstruction, have subsequently been developed.
triple: {'subject': 'Mastectomy', 'relation': 'was once the standard surgical procedure for', 'object': 'breast cancer'}
question: Which surgical procedure was previously considered the standard treatment for breast cancer before the development of newer methods?
distractor 1: Lumpectomy
distractor 2: Sentinel node biopsy
distractor 3: Breast reconstruction

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: **Lumpectomy**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** Lumpectomy is a well-known surgical procedure for breast cancer and is often contrasted with mastectomy. It is plausible as a previous standard treatment, especially for those with some biomedical knowledge, as it is a common alternative to mastectomy.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence clearly states that mastectomy was the standard, and lumpectomy is mentioned as a newer method (breast conserving surgery). Therefore, lumpectomy is definitely incorrect as the answer to the prompt.

---

## Distractor 2: **Sentinel node biopsy**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2**
- **Reasoning:** Sentinel node biopsy is a surgical method related to breast cancer, but it is not a primary treatment for the cancer itself; rather, it is a staging procedure. It is plausible in the biomedical context but less likely to be confused as the standard treatment compared to lumpectomy.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence lists sentinel node biopsy as a newer method, not the previous standard. It is definitely incorrect as the answer.

---

## Distractor 3: **Breast reconstruction**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2**
- **Reasoning:** Breast reconstruction is a surgical procedure associated with breast cancer treatment, but it is not a treatment for the cancer itself; rather, it is a post-treatment procedure. It is somewhat plausible in context but less so as a "standard treatment" for breast cancer.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence lists breast reconstruction as a newer method and not as the previous standard treatment. It is definitely incorrect as the answer.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor                | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility)                                                                 | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness)                                                                 |
|---------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lumpectomy                | 3            | Common alternative to mastectomy; plausible as a standard treatment in context.           | 3             | Clearly not the previous standard per sentence; definitely incorrect.                    |
| Sentinel node biopsy      | 2            | Related to breast cancer surgery, but not a primary treatment; plausible but less so.     | 3             | Listed as a newer method, not the previous standard; definitely incorrect.               |
| Breast reconstruction     | 2            | Associated with breast cancer, but not a treatment; plausible but less so as a standard.  | 3             | Listed as a newer method, not the previous standard; definitely incorrect.               |

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are **incorrect** as answers, as supported by the original sentence and triple.
- **Lumpectomy** is the most plausible distractor, as it is a common alternative and could confuse even experts.
- **Sentinel node biopsy** and **breast reconstruction** are plausible in the biomedical context but less likely to be confused as the previous standard treatment for breast cancer.
