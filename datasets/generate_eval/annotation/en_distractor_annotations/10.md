sentence: On the reaction of oxirane with carboxylic acid, the ester was obtained in a high yieldin a polar solvent such as acetonitrile.
triple: {'subject': 'reaction of oxirane with carboxylic acid', 'relation': 'produces', 'object': 'ester in high yield when performed in a polar solvent such as acetonitrile'}
question: What product is obtained in high yield when oxirane reacts with carboxylic acid in a polar solvent like acetonitrile?
distractor 1: amide
distractor 2: ketone
distractor 3: alcohol

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: **amide**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score:** 2 (Moderately plausible)
- **Reasoning:** Amides are a common product in organic chemistry, especially in reactions involving carboxylic acids and amines. While the prompt involves oxirane (an epoxide) and carboxylic acid, amide formation is not the expected outcome, but it is a plausible answer for someone with basic chemistry knowledge who might confuse reaction types.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score:** 3 (Definitely wrong)
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that the product is an ester, not an amide. There is no mention of an amine or conditions that would favor amide formation, so this is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: **ketone**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score:** 1 (Barely plausible)
- **Reasoning:** Ketones are not typically formed from the reaction of oxirane (epoxide) with carboxylic acid. This is not a common or expected product in this context, so it is not very plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score:** 3 (Definitely wrong)
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not support ketone formation at all. The reaction described would not yield a ketone, making this distractor definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: **alcohol**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score:** 2 (Moderately plausible)
- **Reasoning:** Alcohols can sometimes be formed in reactions involving epoxides, especially under acidic or basic conditions. While not the expected product here, someone might plausibly consider alcohol as a possible outcome, especially if they are not familiar with the specific reaction.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score:** 3 (Definitely wrong)
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify that the product is an ester, not an alcohol. There is no indication that alcohol is formed in this reaction, so this is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score/Reason) | Incorrectness (Score/Reason) |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| amide      | 2: Moderately plausible; possible confusion with carboxylic acid reactions | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by sentence/triple |
| ketone     | 1: Barely plausible; not a typical product in this context | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by sentence/triple |
| alcohol    | 2: Moderately plausible; possible confusion with epoxide reactions | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by sentence/triple |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence and triple.
- "Amide" and "alcohol" are moderately plausible due to their general relevance in organic chemistry, but "ketone" is barely plausible in this specific context.
- None of the distractors are ambiguous or partially correct; they are all definitely wrong for the given reaction.
