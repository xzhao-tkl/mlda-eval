sentence: On the other hand, the adsorbent immobilizing Ricinus Communis Agglutinin, which is one of lectins and can recognize galactose residue, had the selective adhesivity to CD4(+) cells.
triple: {'subject': 'adsorbent immobilizing Ricinus Communis Agglutinin (a galactose-recognizing lectin)', 'relation': 'has selective adhesivity to', 'object': 'CD4(+) cells'}
question: To which type of cells does the adsorbent immobilizing Ricinus Communis Agglutinin show selective adhesivity?
distractor 1: CD8(+) cells
distractor 2: B cells
distractor 3: monocytes

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: **CD8(+) cells**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** CD8(+) cells are another major subset of T cells, closely related to CD4(+) cells. In immunology, questions about selective adhesivity to CD4(+) cells often have CD8(+) cells as a plausible alternative. The distractor fits the expected answer type (cell type), is relevant to the domain, and could easily confuse even experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence explicitly states selective adhesivity to CD4(+) cells, not CD8(+) cells. There is no support for CD8(+) cells in the sentence or triple.

---

## Distractor 2: **B cells**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** B cells are a major immune cell type, but they are not T cells and do not express CD4 in the same way. While plausible as a distractor in a general immunology context, they are less closely related to the subject than CD8(+) cells. Still, someone unfamiliar with the specifics might consider B cells.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple specify CD4(+) cells, which are T cells, not B cells. There is no ambiguity; B cells are not supported.

---

## Distractor 3: **monocytes**

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Monocytes are another type of immune cell, and while they can express some markers similar to T cells, they are not typically associated with CD4(+) selective adhesivity. The distractor is plausible in a broad immunology context but less so than CD8(+) cells.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention monocytes, and selective adhesivity is specified for CD4(+) cells. Monocytes are not supported as the correct answer.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| CD8(+) cells       | 3            | Closely related T cell; fits context and could confuse experts. | 3             | Explicitly not supported by sentence/triple. |
| B cells            | 2            | Major immune cell, but less related to CD4(+) than CD8(+). | 3             | Clearly not supported; not T cells. |
| monocytes          | 2            | Immune cell, plausible but less likely than CD8(+). | 3             | Not supported by sentence/triple. |

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence and triple.
- CD8(+) cells are the most plausible distractor, followed by B cells and monocytes, which are moderately plausible but less likely to confuse experts.
- None of the distractors are implausible or ambiguous in their incorrectness.
