sentence: 多くは開腹下で虫垂切除や回盲部切除などが行われている.
triple: {'subject': '虫垂切除や回盲部切除', 'relation': 'は多くの場合', 'object': '開腹下で行われている'}
question: 虫垂切除や回盲部切除などの手術は多くの場合どのような方法で行われていますか？
distractor 1: 腹腔鏡下
distractor 2: 経皮的
distractor 3: 内視鏡下

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 腹腔鏡下 (Laparoscopic)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "腹腔鏡下" (laparoscopic) is a very common surgical approach for appendectomy and ileocecal resection in modern medicine. It is a plausible alternative to "開腹下" (open surgery), especially in the context of abdominal surgery. It fits the expected answer type (surgical method) and is domain-relevant.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence states that "多くは開腹下で虫垂切除や回盲部切除などが行われている" (most are performed by open surgery). Therefore, "腹腔鏡下" is clearly incorrect for this specific context, as it is not the method described as most common.

---

## Distractor 2: 経皮的 (Percutaneous)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "経皮的" (percutaneous) is a recognized medical approach, but it is not typically used for appendectomy or ileocecal resection. While it is a valid medical term and could theoretically be considered, it is less plausible than "腹腔鏡下" for these specific surgeries. It fits the domain but is less convincing.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifies "開腹下" (open surgery), and "経皮的" is not a standard method for these procedures. Thus, it is definitely incorrect in this context.

---

## Distractor 3: 内視鏡下 (Endoscopic)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "内視鏡下" (endoscopic) is a plausible medical procedure, but it is not the standard approach for appendectomy or ileocecal resection. It is more commonly used for other types of surgeries (e.g., GI tract polypectomy). It fits the domain but is less likely for these specific operations.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence states "開腹下" is the common method, and "内視鏡下" is not the correct answer for these surgeries. Therefore, it is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor      | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 腹腔鏡下         | 3            | Very plausible, common alternative for these surgeries | 3             | Clearly not the method described as most common |
| 経皮的           | 2            | Recognized method, but not typical for these surgeries | 3             | Not the method described, not standard for these procedures |
| 内視鏡下         | 2            | Valid medical term, but not standard for these surgeries | 3             | Not the method described, not standard for these procedures |

## Overall Reasoning

All distractors are clearly incorrect given the original sentence, and all are relevant to the biomedical domain. "腹腔鏡下" is the most plausible distractor, as it is a common alternative for the procedures mentioned. "経皮的" and "内視鏡下" are less plausible but still fit the context as medical procedures. None of the distractors are ambiguous or partially correct for the given sentence.
