sentence: 治療は腹腔内の頻回洗浄を行つたが, 頻回の液交換は白血球の食菌作用や防御因子を減少させるという指摘がある.
triple: {'subject': '頻回の液交換', 'relation': 'は減少させる', 'object': '白血球の食菌作用や防御因子'}
question: 頻回の液交換によって減少すると指摘されているのは何ですか？
distractor 1: 腹腔内の細菌数
distractor 2: 血液中の赤血球数
distractor 3: 腎臓の排泄機能

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 腹腔内の細菌数 (Number of bacteria in the abdominal cavity)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Given the context of frequent peritoneal lavage (腹腔内の頻回洗浄), a reduction in the number of bacteria in the abdominal cavity is a plausible effect. It fits the biomedical context and could easily be confused as the correct answer, especially since the procedure is often performed to reduce infection.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that frequent fluid exchange reduces "白血球の食菌作用や防御因子" (phagocytic activity of leukocytes and defense factors), not the number of bacteria. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 血液中の赤血球数 (Number of red blood cells in the blood)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** While red blood cells are a blood component, the context is about immune defense in the abdominal cavity, not systemic blood cell counts. A layperson might consider blood cell counts relevant, but an expert would rule it out quickly.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not mention red blood cells at all; the effect is on leukocyte function and defense factors, not erythrocytes. This is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 腎臓の排泄機能 (Renal excretory function)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Renal excretory function is not directly related to peritoneal lavage or the immune defense in the abdominal cavity. This distractor is awkward and not contextually relevant; it would be ruled out by anyone with basic biomedical knowledge.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention kidney function at all. The effect is on immune factors, not renal function. This is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1 (腹腔内の細菌数) | 3 | Fits context, plausible effect of lavage | 3 | Not the stated effect in the sentence/triple |
| 2 (血液中の赤血球数) | 2 | Somewhat related to blood, but not immune defense | 3 | Not mentioned, not the effect described |
| 3 (腎臓の排泄機能) | 1 | Not contextually relevant, awkward | 3 | Not mentioned, not the effect described |

---

## Reasoning Summary

- **Distractor 1** is highly plausible and could easily confuse test-takers, but is definitely incorrect per the original sentence.
- **Distractor 2** is moderately plausible, as it relates to blood but not the immune function described, and is definitely incorrect.
- **Distractor 3** is barely plausible, as it is not contextually relevant, and is definitely incorrect.
