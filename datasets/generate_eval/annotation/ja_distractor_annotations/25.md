sentence: 心室性不整脈の出現に強く影響する因子は心機能と梗塞サイズであり,再灌流療法の心室性不整脈の抑制効果は3ヶ月以降ではほとんどなかった。
triple: {'subject': '心室性不整脈の出現', 'relation': 'に強く影響する因子は', 'object': '心機能と梗塞サイズ'}
question: 心室性不整脈の出現に強く影響を与える因子として挙げられるのは何ですか？
distractor 1: 年齢と性別
distractor 2: 血圧と心拍数
distractor 3: 血糖値とコレステロール値

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 年齢と性別 (Age and Sex)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Age and sex are general risk factors for many cardiovascular conditions, including arrhythmias. While not specifically mentioned in the sentence, they are plausible as factors that could influence the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in a broad biomedical context. However, the sentence specifically highlights "心機能と梗塞サイズ" (cardiac function and infarct size), which are more direct physiological factors, making age and sex less immediately relevant.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that the main influencing factors are cardiac function and infarct size. Age and sex are not mentioned and are not supported by the sentence as the correct answer.

---

## Distractor 2: 血圧と心拍数 (Blood Pressure and Heart Rate)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Blood pressure and heart rate are closely related to cardiac function and are commonly considered in the assessment of arrhythmia risk. They are plausible candidates and could easily confuse someone, especially since they are physiological parameters relevant to the context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** Despite their plausibility, the sentence specifically identifies cardiac function and infarct size as the key factors. Blood pressure and heart rate are not mentioned and are not supported by the sentence as the correct answer.

---

## Distractor 3: 血糖値とコレステロール値 (Blood Glucose and Cholesterol Levels)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Blood glucose and cholesterol are risk factors for cardiovascular disease in general, but they are less directly related to the immediate occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias compared to cardiac function and infarct size. They are plausible in a broad biomedical context but less so for this specific prompt.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention blood glucose or cholesterol as influencing factors for ventricular arrhythmias. The correct answer is cardiac function and infarct size, making this distractor definitely wrong.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score/Reason) | Incorrectness (Score/Reason) |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| 年齢と性別 | 2: General risk factors, plausible but less direct | 3: Not supported by sentence |
| 血圧と心拍数 | 3: Highly plausible, closely related to cardiac function | 3: Not supported by sentence |
| 血糖値とコレステロール値 | 2: General cardiovascular risk, less direct | 3: Not supported by sentence |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence and triple, which specifically identify "心機能と梗塞サイズ" as the influencing factors. In terms of plausibility, "血圧と心拍数" is the most convincing distractor due to its close relationship with cardiac function, while the other two are moderately plausible as general cardiovascular risk factors but less directly relevant to the specific context of ventricular arrhythmia occurrence. None of the distractors are implausible or grammatically incorrect.
