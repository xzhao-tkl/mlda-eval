sentence: 分極電圧を小さくするには、porousな表面にすることが必要で、さらに刺激閾値を小さく抑えるために表面積を小さくすると、分極電圧は上昇してしまい、理想的電極作成は困難となった。
triple: {'subject': '分極電圧を小さくする', 'relation': 'ためには', 'object': 'porousな表面にすることが必要である'}
question: 分極電圧を低下させるために必要とされる表面の特徴は何ですか？
distractor 1: 滑らかな表面にすること
distractor 2: 表面積を極端に小さくすること
distractor 3: 絶縁性の高い表面にすること

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 滑らかな表面にすること ("Making the surface smooth")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** In biomedical electrode design, surface texture (smooth vs. porous) is a relevant factor. "Smooth surface" is a plausible alternative to "porous surface" and could be considered by someone unfamiliar with the specifics. However, domain experts know that smooth surfaces generally increase polarization voltage, not decrease it, so it's not highly plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence explicitly states that a porous surface is needed to reduce polarization voltage, implying that a smooth surface would not achieve this. Thus, this distractor is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 表面積を極端に小さくすること ("Making the surface area extremely small")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Surface area is directly discussed in the sentence, and reducing it is mentioned as a way to lower stimulation threshold, but it increases polarization voltage. This distractor is highly plausible because it is a common consideration in electrode design and could easily confuse even experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence states that reducing surface area actually increases polarization voltage, which is the opposite of the desired effect. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 絶縁性の高い表面にすること ("Making the surface highly insulating")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Insulation is a relevant property in biomedical engineering, but a highly insulating surface would prevent current flow, which is not desirable for electrodes. While it is a property that could be considered, it is not directly related to polarization voltage in the context of the sentence, making it moderately plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not support this as a method to reduce polarization voltage; in fact, it would likely worsen electrode performance. Thus, it is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score/Reason) | Incorrectness (Score/Reason) |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1. 滑らかな表面 | 2: Moderately plausible; surface texture is relevant but not ideal | 3: Definitely wrong; contradicts the sentence |
| 2. 表面積小 | 3: Highly plausible; surface area is directly discussed and could confuse experts | 3: Definitely wrong; sentence says it increases voltage |
| 3. 絶縁性高 | 2: Moderately plausible; insulation is relevant but not directly related | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by the sentence |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence, but they vary in plausibility. Distractor 2 is the most plausible and could easily confuse someone, while 1 and 3 are moderately plausible due to their relevance in the domain but are less likely to be chosen by experts. None are implausible or irrelevant.
