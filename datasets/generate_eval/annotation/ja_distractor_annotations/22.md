sentence: セシウム134と137による内部被ばくの預託実効線量は、成人は平均0.055mSv,小児は0.034mSvと推定された。
triple: {'subject': 'セシウム134と137による内部被ばくの預託実効線量', 'relation': 'は推定された', 'object': '成人は平均0.055mSv、小児は0.034mSv'}
question: セシウム134と137による内部被ばくの預託実効線量として推定された成人と小児の平均値はそれぞれいくつですか？
distractor 1: 成人は平均0.10mSv、小児は0.07mSv
distractor 2: 成人は平均0.034mSv、小児は0.055mSv
distractor 3: 成人は平均0.020mSv、小児は0.015mSv

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 成人は平均0.10mSv、小児は0.07mSv

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** The values are realistic and within the expected range for radiation exposure. The format matches the correct answer, and the numbers are plausible for biomedical context (not absurdly high or low). An expert could be momentarily confused.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The values do not match the original sentence (0.055mSv for adults, 0.034mSv for children). There is no ambiguity; these are clearly not the correct values.

---

## Distractor 2: 成人は平均0.034mSv、小児は0.055mSv

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** The numbers are exactly the same as the correct answer but swapped between adult and child. This is a common and plausible distractor in biomedical questions, as the values themselves are reasonable and the swap is subtle.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The values are swapped, so the answer is incorrect for the original sentence. There is no ambiguity; the assignment to adult/child is wrong.

---

## Distractor 3: 成人は平均0.020mSv、小児は0.015mSv

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** The values are lower but still within a plausible range for radiation exposure. The format and context are correct, and the numbers are not absurd, so this could plausibly be an answer.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The values do not match the original sentence. There is no ambiguity; these are clearly not the correct values.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | 3 | Realistic values, correct format, plausible in context | 3 | Values do not match original sentence |
| 2 | 3 | Plausible swap, common distractor, values reasonable | 3 | Swapped values, clearly incorrect |
| 3 | 3 | Lower but plausible values, fits context | 3 | Values do not match original sentence |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are highly plausible in the biomedical context and clearly incorrect based on the original sentence. They are well-constructed and would be effective in a multiple-choice setting.
