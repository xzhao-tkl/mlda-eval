sentence: 本検査法は血清に放射性鉄を加えてインキュベーション後, 未結合の放射性鉄をレジン・ストリップに吸着させて除去し血清の放射性鉄吸着率を求め, 血清不飽和鉄結合能を知るものである。
triple: {'subject': '本検査法', 'relation': 'によって', 'object': '血清不飽和鉄結合能を測定できる'}
question: 血清に放射性鉄を加えてインキュベーションし、未結合の放射性鉄を除去することで本検査法で測定できるのは何ですか？
distractor 1: 血清総鉄結合能
distractor 2: 血清フェリチン濃度
distractor 3: 血清トランスフェリン飽和度

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 血清総鉄結合能 (Serum Total Iron Binding Capacity)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** 血清総鉄結合能 (TIBC) is closely related to 血清不飽和鉄結合能 (UIBC), both are measures of iron binding in serum and often measured together in clinical settings. The method described (adding radioactive iron, measuring binding) is plausible for TIBC as well, making this distractor highly convincing.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically states that the method measures 血清不飽和鉄結合能 (UIBC), not TIBC. While related, they are distinct tests, so this distractor is definitely incorrect for the given sentence.

---

## Distractor 2: 血清フェリチン濃度 (Serum Ferritin Concentration)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Ferritin is a common iron-related marker, but the described method (adding radioactive iron, measuring binding) does not fit standard ferritin measurement techniques (usually immunoassays). However, a non-expert might plausibly confuse ferritin with other iron tests.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The method described does not measure ferritin concentration; it measures iron binding capacity. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 血清トランスフェリン飽和度 (Serum Transferrin Saturation)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Transferrin saturation is calculated from serum iron and TIBC/UIBC, and is a common iron metabolism parameter. The described method could plausibly be thought to relate to transferrin saturation, making this distractor highly plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The method does not directly measure transferrin saturation; it measures UIBC. Transferrin saturation is derived from other values, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1 (TIBC)   | 3            | Closely related test, plausible method | 3            | Not the test described, clearly incorrect |
| 2 (Ferritin)| 2           | Common iron marker, but method doesn't fit | 3            | Method does not measure ferritin |
| 3 (Transferrin Saturation)| 3 | Related parameter, plausible confusion | 3            | Not directly measured by method |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are clearly incorrect for the original sentence, but are plausible in the biomedical context, especially 1 and 3. Distractor 2 is less plausible due to the mismatch in measurement method, but still relevant as a common iron-related test. All distractors are well-constructed for a challenging multiple-choice question.
