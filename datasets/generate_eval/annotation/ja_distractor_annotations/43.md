sentence: たとえば, 膜反応器の転化率には上限値である理想最大転化率が存在することを明らかにするとともに, 理想最大転化率と膜の選択率および反応の平衡定数との関係などを明らかにした.
triple: {'subject': '膜反応器の転化率', 'relation': 'には上限値が存在する', 'object': '理想最大転化率'}
question: 上限値として理想最大転化率が存在するのは何の転化率ですか？
distractor 1: 固定床反応器の転化率
distractor 2: 流動床反応器の転化率
distractor 3: 連続撹拌槽反応器の転化率

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 固定床反応器の転化率 (Fixed-bed reactor conversion)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Fixed-bed reactors are a common type of chemical reactor, and "転化率" (conversion rate) is a standard metric for reactors. The question is about the upper limit of conversion rate for a reactor type, so this distractor fits the expected answer type and domain perfectly. It could easily confuse someone who is not paying close attention to the specific reactor type mentioned in the original sentence.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify "膜反応器" (membrane reactor), not "固定床反応器" (fixed-bed reactor). There is no mention of the ideal maximum conversion rate for fixed-bed reactors in the sentence, so this is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 流動床反応器の転化率 (Fluidized-bed reactor conversion)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Fluidized-bed reactors are also a standard type in chemical engineering, and their conversion rates are often discussed. The distractor matches the expected answer type and is relevant in the context of reactor types and conversion rates. It is plausible and could be mistaken for the correct answer.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence is about membrane reactors, not fluidized-bed reactors. There is no indication that the ideal maximum conversion rate applies to fluidized-bed reactors in this context, so this is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 連続撹拌槽反応器の転化率 (Continuous stirred-tank reactor conversion)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTRs) are another major reactor type, and their conversion rates are a common topic. This distractor fits the expected answer type and is relevant in the context of reactor conversion rates. It is plausible and could be chosen by someone not paying attention to the specific reactor type in the original sentence.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple are about membrane reactors, not CSTRs. There is no mention of the ideal maximum conversion rate for CSTRs, so this is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 固定床反応器の転化率 | 3 | Common reactor, fits context | 3 | Not mentioned, clearly wrong |
| 流動床反応器の転化率 | 3 | Common reactor, fits context | 3 | Not mentioned, clearly wrong |
| 連続撹拌槽反応器の転化率 | 3 | Common reactor, fits context | 3 | Not mentioned, clearly wrong |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All three distractors are highly plausible because they are standard reactor types whose conversion rates are often discussed in the same context as membrane reactors. They fit the expected answer type and could easily confuse someone who does not notice the specific reactor type in the original sentence. However, they are all definitely incorrect because the sentence and triple only refer to membrane reactors, not the other types. Thus, these distractors are well-designed for a biomedical/chemical engineering multiple-choice question.
