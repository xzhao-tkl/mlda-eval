sentence: 痒みメディエーターはアレルギーを誘引する報告もあり、痒みに対する掻把から炎症に繋がることも考えられる。
triple: {'subject': '痒みに対する掻把', 'relation': 'から', 'object': '炎症に繋がる'}
question: 痒みがある際に炎症につながる原因となる行動は何ですか？
distractor 1: 冷却
distractor 2: 保湿
distractor 3: 洗浄

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

### Distractor 1: 冷却 (Cooling)

#### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Cooling is a common response to itch or inflammation, and in the biomedical context, it is plausible as an action someone might take when experiencing itch. However, cooling is generally considered to reduce inflammation, not cause it, so while it fits the context of "actions taken when itchy," it is less plausible as a cause of inflammation.

#### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that "掻把" (scratching) leads to inflammation. Cooling does not lead to inflammation and is not supported by the sentence, making it definitely incorrect.

---

### Distractor 2: 保湿 (Moisturizing)

#### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Moisturizing is a typical action for itchy skin, especially in dermatological contexts. It is plausible as a response to itch, but moisturizing is generally protective and reduces inflammation, so it is not a plausible cause of inflammation.

#### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not support moisturizing as a cause of inflammation; in fact, it is usually the opposite. Therefore, it is definitely incorrect.

---

### Distractor 3: 洗浄 (Washing/Cleansing)

#### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Washing is a common action for itchy skin and fits the biomedical context. However, washing is not typically a direct cause of inflammation unless done excessively or with harsh substances, which is not specified here. It is plausible as an action but less so as a cause of inflammation.

#### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not support washing as a cause of inflammation. The only supported cause is scratching, so this is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 冷却       | 2            | Common action for itch, but not a cause of inflammation | 3            | Not supported by sentence/triple; does not cause inflammation |
| 保湿       | 2            | Typical response to itch, but protective, not causative | 3            | Not supported; moisturizing does not cause inflammation |
| 洗浄       | 2            | Common action, but not typically causative | 3            | Not supported; washing does not cause inflammation |

## Overall Reasoning

All distractors are moderately plausible as actions taken in response to itch in a biomedical context, but none are plausible as causes of inflammation according to the original sentence and triple. All are definitely incorrect as answers to the specific question posed.
