sentence: 神経線維の膨大した終末と褐色脂肪細胞および毛細血管との間にシナップスが形成される.
triple: {'subject': '神経線維の膨大した終末', 'relation': 'は', 'object': '褐色脂肪細胞および毛細血管との間にシナプスを形成する'}
question: 神経線維の膨大した終末がシナプスを形成する相手として挙げられる細胞や構造は何ですか？
distractor 1: 白色脂肪細胞およびリンパ管
distractor 2: 筋線維および動脈血管
distractor 3: 線維芽細胞および静脈血管

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 白色脂肪細胞およびリンパ管 (White adipocytes and lymphatic vessels)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** White adipocytes are a type of fat cell, similar to brown adipocytes (the correct answer), and lymphatic vessels are a type of vessel, somewhat analogous to capillaries. Both are plausible as targets for nerve endings in a biomedical context, though less commonly associated with synapse formation compared to the correct answer. An expert would likely rule this out, but it is not immediately nonsensical.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically mentions "褐色脂肪細胞および毛細血管" (brown adipocytes and capillaries), not white adipocytes or lymphatic vessels. There is no support for this distractor in the original sentence.

---

## Distractor 2: 筋線維および動脈血管 (Muscle fibers and arterial vessels)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Muscle fibers are a common target for nerve endings (e.g., neuromuscular junctions), and arteries are a type of blood vessel. While plausible in a general biomedical context, the original sentence does not mention these structures, and their pairing is less typical for the context of brown adipose tissue innervation.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not support muscle fibers or arterial vessels as synaptic targets for the nerve endings described. This distractor is clearly incorrect based on the provided information.

---

## Distractor 3: 線維芽細胞および静脈血管 (Fibroblasts and venous vessels)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Fibroblasts are connective tissue cells and are not typical targets for synapse formation by nerve endings. Venous vessels are blood vessels, but the combination is less plausible in the context of synaptic formation compared to the correct answer. This distractor is less convincing and would be easily ruled out by someone with basic biomedical knowledge.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention fibroblasts or venous vessels as synaptic partners for nerve endings. This distractor is clearly incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score/Reason) | Incorrectness (Score/Reason) |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1: 白色脂肪細胞およびリンパ管 | 2: Similar cell/vessel types, plausible but less common | 3: Not supported by sentence |
| 2: 筋線維および動脈血管 | 2: Common nerve targets, but not in this context | 3: Not supported by sentence |
| 3: 線維芽細胞および静脈血管 | 1: Unlikely synaptic targets, easily ruled out | 3: Not supported by sentence |

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence and triple.
- Distractor 1 and 2 are moderately plausible due to their similarity to the correct answer's cell/vessel types, but would be ruled out by domain knowledge.
- Distractor 3 is barely plausible, as fibroblasts are not typical synaptic targets, making it the weakest distractor in terms of plausibility.
