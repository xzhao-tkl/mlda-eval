sentence: 3. 肉の種属鑑別法の術式としては Ouchterlony 法を改良した寒天ゲル内沈降反応が適当であった。
triple: {'subject': '肉の種属鑑別法の術式', 'relation': 'として適当である', 'object': 'Ouchterlony法を改良した寒天ゲル内沈降反応'}
question: 肉の種属鑑別法の術式として適当とされる方法は何ですか？
distractor 1: ELISA法による抗原抗体反応
distractor 2: PCR法による遺伝子解析
distractor 3: 免疫電気泳動法

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1: ELISA法による抗原抗体反応

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) is a well-known immunological method for detecting antigen-antibody reactions. In the context of species identification in meat, ELISA is a plausible alternative, as it is used in biomedical and food testing domains. It fits the expected answer type (a method) and is relevant to the subject (species identification technique).

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically states that the Ouchterlony method (modified agar gel precipitation reaction) is appropriate. ELISA is a different technique and is not mentioned or implied as the correct answer in the sentence. Therefore, it is clearly incorrect.

## Distractor 2: PCR法による遺伝子解析

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) for genetic analysis is a very common and advanced method for species identification, especially in modern biomedical and food science. It is highly plausible as an answer, fitting both the domain and the context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention PCR or genetic analysis; it focuses on immunological precipitation reactions. PCR is a different approach and not the correct answer for the method described in the sentence.

---

## Distractor 3: 免疫電気泳動法

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Immunoelectrophoresis is another immunological technique used for protein and antigen-antibody analysis. It is plausible in the context of species identification and fits the expected answer type and domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifies the modified Ouchterlony method (agar gel precipitation), not immunoelectrophoresis. Thus, this distractor is clearly incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| ELISA法による抗原抗体反応 | 3 | Common, relevant immunological method | 3 | Not the method described in the sentence |
| PCR法による遺伝子解析 | 3 | Advanced, plausible species ID method | 3 | Not mentioned or implied in the sentence |
| 免疫電気泳動法 | 3 | Related immunological technique | 3 | Not the method described in the sentence |

## **Overall Assessment**
All three distractors are **highly plausible** in the biomedical context and **definitely incorrect** given the original sentence and triple. They are well-designed distractors for this multiple-choice question.
