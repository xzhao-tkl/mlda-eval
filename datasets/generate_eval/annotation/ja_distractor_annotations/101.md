sentence: 転移性脳腫瘍の診療は, 放射線治療や薬物療法の目覚ましい発展により, 急速な変化を遂げつつある.
triple: {'subject': '転移性脳腫瘍の診療', 'relation': 'は', 'object': '放射線治療や薬物療法の目覚ましい発展により急速な変化を遂げつつある'}
question: 転移性脳腫瘍の診療が急速に変化している主な要因は何ですか？
distractor 1: 外科的手術の停滞
distractor 2: リハビリテーション技術の進歩
distractor 3: 画像診断技術の普及

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 外科的手術の停滞 (Stagnation of surgical procedures)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 1**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The prompt asks for the main factor driving rapid change in the treatment of metastatic brain tumors. "Stagnation of surgical procedures" is not plausible as a driver of rapid change; stagnation implies lack of progress, which is the opposite of what the question is asking. While surgery is a relevant domain, the idea of "stagnation" as a cause for rapid change is awkward and easily ruled out.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The original sentence clearly states that rapid change is due to advances in radiation therapy and drug therapy, not stagnation in surgery. This distractor is definitely wrong and not supported by the sentence.

---

## Distractor 2: リハビリテーション技術の進歩 (Advances in rehabilitation technology)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2**
- **Reasoning:**  
  Advances in rehabilitation technology could plausibly affect the management of brain tumors, as rehabilitation is part of patient care. However, it is not as directly relevant as radiation or drug therapy for the main driver of rapid change in treatment. It fits the biomedical domain but is only moderately plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The original sentence does not mention rehabilitation technology as a factor in the rapid change. Therefore, this distractor is definitely wrong for the specific context.

---

## Distractor 3: 画像診断技術の普及 (Spread of imaging diagnostic technology)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The spread of imaging diagnostic technology is highly plausible as a factor that could drive changes in the management of metastatic brain tumors. Imaging is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, and its advancement could reasonably be mistaken for the main driver of change. This could confuse even experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The original sentence attributes rapid change specifically to advances in radiation therapy and drug therapy, not imaging technology. Thus, this distractor is definitely wrong for the given sentence.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1. 外科的手術の停滞 | 1 | Stagnation is not a plausible driver of rapid change | 3 | Clearly not supported by the sentence |
| 2. リハビリテーション技術の進歩 | 2 | Somewhat plausible, but not directly relevant | 3 | Not mentioned as a factor in the sentence |
| 3. 画像診断技術の普及 | 3 | Highly plausible, fits domain and context | 3 | Not the answer given in the sentence |

## Overall Reasoning

- Distractor 1 is barely plausible and definitely incorrect.
- Distractor 2 is moderately plausible and definitely incorrect.
- Distractor 3 is highly plausible and definitely incorrect.

Distractor 3 is the strongest distractor, as it could easily confuse someone familiar with the domain, while the other two are easier to rule out. All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence.
