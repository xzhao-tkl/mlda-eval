sentence: 唇顎口蓋裂の治療にあたっては,特に顎裂に近接する歯はできる限り保存するように努め,成長期にある患者の上顎に対する外科的侵襲を最少限にとどめ,また将来の補綴処置にも不利にならないよう総合的な治療の観点から,処置方針をたてるべきであると考える.
triple: {'subject': '唇顎口蓋裂の治療', 'relation': 'においては', 'object': '顎裂に近接する歯をできる限り保存し、成長期患者の上顎への外科的侵襲を最少限にとどめ、将来の補綴処置にも不利にならないよう総合的な治療方針を立てる'}
question: 唇顎口蓋裂の治療において、特に保存に努めるべき歯はどれですか？
distractor 1: 下顎前歯
distractor 2: 上顎遠心側の臼歯
distractor 3: 乳歯全体

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 下顎前歯 (Mandibular anterior teeth)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The question is about which teeth should be especially preserved in the treatment of cleft lip and palate. While the original sentence specifies "teeth close to the alveolar cleft," mandibular anterior teeth are not anatomically close to the maxillary cleft. However, for someone less familiar with craniofacial anatomy, "anterior teeth" might sound plausible, especially since dental preservation is generally important. Still, domain experts would quickly rule this out.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The original sentence clearly refers to teeth near the alveolar cleft, which are in the maxilla (upper jaw), not the mandible (lower jaw). Thus, mandibular anterior teeth are definitely not the correct answer.

## Distractor 2: 上顎遠心側の臼歯 (Maxillary distal molars)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  These teeth are in the maxilla, which is the correct jaw, and "distal molars" could be interpreted as being near the cleft depending on the cleft's location. For someone not deeply familiar with the typical location of the cleft, this is a very plausible distractor and could confuse even experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The original sentence specifies "teeth close to the alveolar cleft," which are usually not the distal molars but rather teeth adjacent to the cleft (often lateral incisors or canines). Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 乳歯全体 (All primary teeth)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  Preserving all primary teeth is a general dental principle, especially in pediatric patients. However, the question asks for "especially" which teeth should be preserved, and the original sentence focuses on those near the cleft. This distractor is plausible for a general audience but less so for experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The original sentence does not advocate for preserving all primary teeth, but specifically those near the cleft. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 下顎前歯 | 2 | Somewhat plausible, but not anatomically correct | 3 | Clearly not the teeth near the cleft |
| 上顎遠心側の臼歯 | 3 | Very plausible, could confuse experts | 3 | Not the teeth adjacent to the cleft |
| 乳歯全体 | 2 | General dental principle, but not specific | 3 | Not what the sentence specifies |

---

## **Overall Assessment**
- All distractors are clearly incorrect, matching the original sentence's intent.
- Distractor 2 is the most plausible and would be the best distractor for challenging test-takers.
- Distractors 1 and 3 are moderately plausible, suitable for a general audience but less likely to confuse experts.
