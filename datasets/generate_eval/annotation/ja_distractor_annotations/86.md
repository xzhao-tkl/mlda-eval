sentence: 最近の,脳波や脳磁図,光遺伝学といった電気生理学的研究の進歩や,死後脳研究の知見により,皮質の周期的神経活動(neural oscillation)の異常が,精神疾患の病態生理に深くかかわっていることがわかってきた。
triple: {'subject': '皮質の周期的神経活動（neural oscillation）の異常', 'relation': 'は深く関与している', 'object': '精神疾患の病態生理'}
question: 皮質の周期的神経活動（neural oscillation）の異常が深く関与しているのは何の病態生理ですか？
distractor 1: 神経変性疾患の病態生理
distractor 2: 心血管疾患の病態生理
distractor 3: 内分泌疾患の病態生理

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 神経変性疾患の病態生理 (Pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's) are closely related to neural activity and brain function. Abnormal neural oscillations could plausibly be involved in their pathophysiology. The distractor fits the biomedical context and could easily confuse even experts, as both neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders involve brain dysfunction.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specifically state that the abnormal neural oscillations are deeply involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, not neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, this distractor is clearly incorrect for this specific context.

---

## Distractor 2: 心血管疾患の病態生理 (Pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** While cardiovascular diseases are not directly related to neural oscillations, there is some research on brain-heart interactions. However, in the context of "neural oscillations" and "brain research," this is less plausible than neurodegenerative diseases but still not completely out of place in a biomedical setting.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention cardiovascular diseases at all. The connection is not supported by the given information, making this distractor definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 内分泌疾患の病態生理 (Pathophysiology of endocrine diseases)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Endocrine diseases (e.g., diabetes, thyroid disorders) are generally not associated with neural oscillations or brain electrophysiology. This distractor is awkward and can be ruled out by basic domain knowledge, as the connection is very weak.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not support any connection between neural oscillations and endocrine diseases. This distractor is clearly incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1 (Neurodegenerative) | 3 | Fits domain, could confuse experts | 3 | Not supported by sentence/triple |
| 2 (Cardiovascular)    | 2 | Some biomedical overlap, but less direct | 3 | Not supported by sentence/triple |
| 3 (Endocrine)         | 1 | Weak/awkward, easily ruled out | 3 | Not supported by sentence/triple |

---

## Overall Reasoning
- Distractor 1 is the strongest, as it is highly plausible and could easily be mistaken for the correct answer in a biomedical context.
- Distractor 2 is moderately plausible, but less so than 1.
- Distractor 3 is barely plausible and easily ruled out.
- All distractors are definitely incorrect given the original sentence and triple.
