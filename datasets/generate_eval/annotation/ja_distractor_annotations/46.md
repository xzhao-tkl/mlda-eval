sentence: 本実験に認めた乳歯髄の変化は,乳歯窩洞形成後に認められる歯髄の所見と類似すること,コンポジットレジン応用後に認められる著明な歯髄の変化を欠くことから,本実験に川いられた間接歯髄覆罩剤Procalは,コンポジットレジンによってもたらされる歯髄の為害作用を遮断して,間接歯髄覆罩剤としての効果を発揮したものと結論した.
triple: {'subject': '間接歯髄覆罩剤Procal', 'relation': 'はコンポジットレジンによってもたらされる歯髄の為害作用を遮断し', 'object': '間接歯髄覆罩剤としての効果を発揮した'}
question: コンポジットレジンによる歯髄の為害作用を遮断し、間接歯髄覆罩剤としての効果を発揮したのは何ですか？
distractor 1: 直接歯髄覆罩剤カルシウム水酸化物
distractor 2: グラスアイオノマーセメント
distractor 3: コンポジットレジン単独

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 直接歯髄覆罩剤カルシウム水酸化物 (Direct pulp capping agent calcium hydroxide)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Calcium hydroxide is a well-known pulp capping agent in dentistry, and its mention is plausible in the context of pulp protection. However, the original sentence specifically discusses "間接歯髄覆罩剤Procal" (indirect pulp capping agent Procal), not direct pulp capping agents. While related, the role and application are different, so an expert would likely rule it out, but it could confuse non-experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that "Procal" (an indirect pulp capping agent) is the one that blocks the harmful effects and shows efficacy. Calcium hydroxide is not mentioned as performing this specific function in the context given.

---

## Distractor 2: グラスアイオノマーセメント (Glass ionomer cement)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Glass ionomer cement is commonly used in dental procedures and could be considered for pulp protection. However, the sentence does not mention it as the agent responsible for the described effect. It is plausible in the domain but not directly supported by the context.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple attribute the effect to "Procal," not glass ionomer cement. There is no evidence in the sentence that glass ionomer cement performed the described function.

---

## Distractor 3: コンポジットレジン単独 (Composite resin alone)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Composite resin is directly discussed in the sentence as causing harmful effects to the pulp, which Procal is said to block. Thus, it is very plausible as a distractor because it is central to the context and could easily confuse someone who does not read carefully.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence explicitly states that composite resin alone causes harmful effects, and Procal is used to block these effects. Therefore, composite resin alone is definitely not the correct answer.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1. 直接歯髄覆罩剤カルシウム水酸化物 | 2 | Related agent, but not the one described | 3 | Not supported by sentence/triple |
| 2. グラスアイオノマーセメント | 2 | Common dental material, but not described as effective here | 3 | Not supported by sentence/triple |
| 3. コンポジットレジン単独 | 3 | Central to context, could confuse readers | 3 | Explicitly described as harmful, not effective |

---

## Overall Reasoning

- All distractors are **incorrect** per the original sentence and triple.
- Distractor 3 is the most **plausible** due to its direct relevance and potential to confuse.
- Distractors 1 and 2 are **moderately plausible** as they are related dental materials but not the ones described as effective in the sentence.
