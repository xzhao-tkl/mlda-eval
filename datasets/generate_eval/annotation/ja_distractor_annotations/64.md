sentence: 白血球数増多でleukostasis発症は増えるが,芽球の大きさ,変形能,接着因子の発現などもleukostasisの発症に関与する.
triple: {'subject': '白血球数増多', 'relation': 'は発症を増やす', 'object': 'leukostasis'}
question: 白血球数増多によって発症が増加する疾患は何ですか？
distractor 1: 血栓症
distractor 2: 敗血症
distractor 3: 貧血

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 血栓症 (Thrombosis)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Thrombosis is a condition related to blood and can be associated with changes in blood cell counts. In the biomedical context, increased white blood cell count (白血球数増多) could theoretically contribute to blood viscosity and thrombosis risk, making it a plausible but not highly convincing distractor. However, the original sentence specifically links leukostasis (a distinct phenomenon) to increased white blood cell count, not thrombosis.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that leukostasis is the disease whose incidence increases with elevated white blood cell count. Thrombosis is not mentioned or implied as the correct answer, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 敗血症 (Sepsis)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Sepsis is a systemic infection that can be associated with changes in white blood cell count. In clinical practice, leukocytosis (白血球数増多) is often seen in sepsis, but the relationship is not causative in the way described in the prompt. The distractor is plausible in the biomedical context but does not fit the specific mechanism described in the sentence.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not support sepsis as the disease whose incidence increases due to elevated white blood cell count. The correct answer is leukostasis, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 貧血 (Anemia)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Anemia is a condition related to red blood cells, not white blood cells. The connection between increased white blood cell count and anemia is weak and not commonly made in biomedical contexts. This distractor is easily ruled out by basic domain knowledge.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not support anemia as the disease whose incidence increases with elevated white blood cell count. The correct answer is leukostasis, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score/Reason) | Incorrectness (Score/Reason) |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| 血栓症     | 2: Moderately plausible; related to blood, but not the specific disease described | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by the sentence/triple |
| 敗血症     | 2: Moderately plausible; associated with WBC count, but not causative as described | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by the sentence/triple |
| 貧血       | 1: Barely plausible; unrelated to WBC count, easily ruled out | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by the sentence/triple |

## Overall Reasoning

- **血栓症** and **敗血症** are plausible distractors in the biomedical context, but do not fit the specific mechanism described in the sentence.
- **貧血** is not a plausible distractor due to its lack of connection to white blood cell count.
- All distractors are definitely incorrect based on the original sentence and triple.
