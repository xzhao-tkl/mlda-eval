sentence: 閉塞性大腸癌は, 癌を切除する前に緊急減圧処置を必要とするoncologic emergencyの一つであり, 処置のタイミングや方法を誤ると致命的となる.
triple: {'subject': '閉塞性大腸癌', 'relation': 'は', 'object': '癌を切除する前に緊急減圧処置を必要とする腫瘍学的救急疾患（oncologic emergency）の一つ'}
question: 癌を切除する前に緊急で必要となる処置は、閉塞性大腸癌の場合どのようなものですか？
distractor 1: 緊急止血処置
distractor 2: 緊急抗菌薬投与
distractor 3: 緊急輸液療法

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 緊急止血処置 (Emergency hemostasis procedure)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
Hemostasis procedures are common in oncology emergencies, especially for bleeding tumors. While "閉塞性大腸癌" (obstructive colon cancer) is more associated with obstruction and not bleeding, emergency hemostasis could be considered in some GI cancers. It fits the domain and is a plausible emergency intervention, but not the most expected for obstruction.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
The original sentence clearly states that the emergency procedure required is "減圧処置" (decompression), not hemostasis. There is no mention of bleeding or the need for hemostasis in the context of obstructive colon cancer.

## Distractor 2: 緊急抗菌薬投与 (Emergency antibiotic administration)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
Antibiotics are sometimes used in GI emergencies, especially if perforation or infection is suspected. However, for obstructive colon cancer, the primary emergency is decompression, not infection control. Still, it is a plausible medical intervention in emergencies.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
The sentence specifies that the emergency procedure is decompression, not antibiotics. There is no indication of infection or sepsis in the prompt.

---

## Distractor 3: 緊急輸液療法 (Emergency fluid therapy)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
Fluid therapy is a common supportive measure in many emergencies, including GI obstruction, to prevent dehydration or shock. However, it is not the specific emergency procedure required for obstructive colon cancer; decompression is the key intervention.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
The original sentence is clear that decompression is the required emergency procedure, not fluid therapy. Fluid therapy may be supportive but is not the main intervention.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 緊急止血処置 | 2 | Fits emergency context, but not typical for obstruction | 3 | Not supported by sentence, decompression is required |
| 緊急抗菌薬投与 | 2 | Plausible in emergencies, but not for obstruction | 3 | No mention of infection, decompression is required |
| 緊急輸液療法 | 2 | Common supportive measure, but not the main intervention | 3 | Not the emergency procedure specified in sentence |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are moderately plausible as emergency interventions in the biomedical domain, but none are the specific emergency procedure (decompression) required for obstructive colon cancer as stated in the original sentence. All are definitely incorrect in this context.
