sentence: ECIRS後に全身状態が悪化した際に,頻度は低いものの敗血症性ショックも鑑別にあげたことで,敗血症に対する集中治療を早期に開始できた.
triple: {'subject': 'ECIRS後に全身状態が悪化した症例', 'relation': 'で敗血症性ショックを鑑別にあげることで', 'object': '敗血症に対する集中治療を早期に開始できる'}
question: ECIRS後に全身状態が悪化した場合、早期に敗血症に対する集中治療を開始するために鑑別にあげるべき疾患は何ですか？
distractor 1: 心原性ショック
distractor 2: アナフィラキシーショック
distractor 3: 出血性ショック

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 心原性ショック (Cardiogenic shock)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
Cardiogenic shock is a type of shock that can occur in clinical settings and is a plausible differential diagnosis for a patient with deteriorating general condition after a procedure. However, the context (ECIRS, a urological procedure) and the focus on sepsis make cardiogenic shock less likely than septic shock, but it is still a reasonable consideration for clinicians.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
The original sentence and triple clearly state that "敗血症性ショック" (septic shock) should be considered to enable early intensive care for sepsis. Cardiogenic shock is a different pathophysiological entity and is not supported by the sentence or triple.

---

## Distractor 2: アナフィラキシーショック (Anaphylactic shock)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
Anaphylactic shock is a possible cause of sudden deterioration after a medical procedure, especially if there is exposure to drugs or contrast agents. While less common in the context of ECIRS, it is still a plausible differential diagnosis in the biomedical domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
The sentence and triple focus on sepsis and septic shock, not anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic shock is not supported by the original information and is clearly incorrect in this context.

---

## Distractor 3: 出血性ショック (Hemorrhagic shock)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
Hemorrhagic shock is a very plausible differential diagnosis after ECIRS, which is a surgical procedure with risk of bleeding. Clinicians would definitely consider hemorrhagic shock if a patient’s condition worsens postoperatively.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
Despite its plausibility, the original sentence and triple specifically mention septic shock and sepsis as the reason for early intensive care. Hemorrhagic shock is not the correct answer according to the provided information.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 心原性ショック | 2 | Possible but less likely in this context | 3 | Clearly not supported by the sentence/triple |
| アナフィラキシーショック | 2 | Possible, especially with drug exposure | 3 | Clearly not supported by the sentence/triple |
| 出血性ショック | 3 | Highly plausible after ECIRS | 3 | Clearly not supported by the sentence/triple |

---

## Overall Reasoning
All distractors are incorrect as per the original sentence and triple, but they vary in plausibility. Hemorrhagic shock is the most plausible in this clinical context, while cardiogenic and anaphylactic shock are moderately plausible. None of the distractors are the correct answer, and all are valid as distractors for this biomedical multiple-choice question.
