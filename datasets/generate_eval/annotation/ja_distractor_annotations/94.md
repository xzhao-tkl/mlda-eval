sentence: 超音波診断による胸腔内の液体成分の検出能は非常に高く,X線では指摘できないような極めて少量の胸水でも描出可能である.
triple: {'subject': '超音波診断', 'relation': 'による胸腔内の液体成分の検出能は', 'object': '非常に高く、X線では指摘できないような極めて少量の胸水でも描出可能である'}
question: 超音波診断による胸腔内の液体成分の検出能について、X線では指摘できないような極めて少量の胸水でも描出可能であることをどのように表現できますか？
distractor 1: 低く、胸水の検出にはX線の方が優れている
distractor 2: 中程度で、少量の胸水は検出できない
distractor 3: 高いが、X線と同程度の胸水しか描出できない

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 低く、胸水の検出にはX線の方が優れている

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
This option is plausible in the sense that it presents an alternative diagnostic scenario (ultrasound is less sensitive than X-ray), which is a conceivable but incorrect statement in the biomedical context. It fits the expected answer type and is grammatically correct. However, domain experts would know this is not true, as ultrasound is known to be more sensitive for pleural effusion than X-ray.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
The original sentence clearly states that ultrasound is *more* sensitive than X-ray for detecting even small amounts of pleural fluid. This distractor directly contradicts the original information, making it definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 中程度で、少量の胸水は検出できない

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
This distractor is very convincing. It suggests that ultrasound has moderate sensitivity and cannot detect small amounts of pleural fluid, which is a subtle and believable alternative. It fits the context and could easily confuse someone who is not an expert.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
The original sentence states that ultrasound can detect even very small amounts of pleural fluid, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 高いが、X線と同程度の胸水しか描出できない

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
This distractor is highly plausible because it acknowledges that ultrasound is sensitive ("高い") but limits its capability to the same as X-ray, which is a nuanced and believable statement. It fits the context and could mislead even those with some domain knowledge.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
The original sentence states that ultrasound can detect much smaller amounts of pleural fluid than X-ray, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | 2 | Plausible alternative, but experts would know it's false | 3 | Directly contradicts original sentence |
| 2 | 3 | Subtle, fits context, could confuse non-experts | 3 | Contradicts original sentence |
| 3 | 3 | Nuanced, fits context, could mislead | 3 | Contradicts original sentence |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence and triple.
- Distractors 2 and 3 are highly plausible and could easily confuse test-takers, while distractor 1 is moderately plausible but less subtle.
- The distractors are well-constructed for a biomedical multiple-choice question.
