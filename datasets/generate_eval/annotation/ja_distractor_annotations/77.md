sentence: 胆嚢癌は原発巣の位置, 浸潤様式によりさまざまな進展を呈するという事実を知った上でこれらを術前診断し, 進展度に見合った切除術式を立案する必要がある.
triple: {'subject': '胆嚢癌', 'relation': 'は原発巣の位置や浸潤様式により', 'object': 'さまざまな進展を呈する'}
question: 原発巣の位置や浸潤様式によってさまざまな進展を示すのはどの疾患ですか？
distractor 1: 肝細胞癌
distractor 2: 膵臓癌
distractor 3: 胆管癌

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 肝細胞癌 (Hepatocellular carcinoma)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** 肝細胞癌 is a liver cancer, and its progression can depend on the location and invasion pattern, similar to gallbladder cancer (胆嚢癌). In the biomedical context, it is plausible as a distractor because it is a common hepatobiliary malignancy and could be confused with gallbladder cancer by non-experts. However, the original sentence specifically discusses gallbladder cancer, so an expert would rule this out.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly refer to gallbladder cancer (胆嚢癌), not hepatocellular carcinoma. 肝細胞癌 is not supported by the sentence, making it definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 膵臓癌 (Pancreatic cancer)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Pancreatic cancer is another abdominal malignancy whose progression can depend on location and invasion pattern. It is plausible in the context of a question about cancer progression in the hepatobiliary system, but the sentence is about gallbladder cancer, so it is not highly plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not mention pancreatic cancer. 膵臓癌 is not the correct answer and is not supported by the original information.

---

## Distractor 3: 胆管癌 (Bile duct cancer)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Bile duct cancer is anatomically and clinically very close to gallbladder cancer. Its progression can also depend on the location and invasion pattern, making it a very convincing distractor. It could easily confuse even experts, especially since the clinical management and diagnostic approach can overlap.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple specifically refer to gallbladder cancer (胆嚢癌), not bile duct cancer. 胆管癌 is not supported by the original sentence, making it definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 肝細胞癌   | 2            | Common hepatobiliary cancer, plausible but not specific to the sentence. | 3 | Not supported by the sentence/triple. |
| 膵臓癌     | 2            | Another abdominal cancer, plausible but less specific. | 3 | Not supported by the sentence/triple. |
| 胆管癌     | 3            | Very close in context and clinical features, highly plausible. | 3 | Not supported by the sentence/triple. |

## Overall Reasoning

All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence and triple, so they score 3 for incorrectness. In terms of plausibility, 肝細胞癌 and 膵臓癌 are moderately plausible due to their anatomical proximity and similar clinical considerations, but 胆管癌 is highly plausible due to its close relationship with gallbladder cancer in both anatomy and clinical management. This set of distractors is well-constructed for a biomedical multiple-choice question.
