sentence: 片肺換気を必要とする麻酔時に,術中低酸素状態をきたすことがある.
triple: {'subject': '片肺換気を必要とする麻酔時', 'relation': 'では', 'object': '術中低酸素状態をきたすことがある'}
question: 片肺換気を必要とする麻酔時に生じる可能性がある状態は何ですか？
distractor 1: 術中高二酸化炭素血症
distractor 2: 術中高血圧状態
distractor 3: 術中頻脈

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 術中高二酸化炭素血症 (Intraoperative hypercapnia)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Hypercapnia (high CO₂) is a well-known complication during anesthesia, especially with altered ventilation such as one-lung ventilation. It is a plausible answer that could confuse even experts, as both hypoxemia (the correct answer) and hypercapnia are respiratory complications.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify "低酸素状態" (hypoxemia), not hypercapnia. There is no mention of CO₂ retention, so this distractor is definitely incorrect for this specific prompt.

---

## Distractor 2: 術中高血圧状態 (Intraoperative hypertension)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Hypertension can occur during anesthesia, but it is less directly related to one-lung ventilation. It is plausible in a general anesthesia context, but less so for the specific scenario described (one-lung ventilation, which is more likely to cause hypoxemia or hypercapnia).

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not mention blood pressure issues; the complication is hypoxemia. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 術中頻脈 (Intraoperative tachycardia)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Tachycardia can occur as a secondary response to hypoxemia or other intraoperative events, but it is not a primary complication of one-lung ventilation. It is plausible but less direct than hypoxemia or hypercapnia.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention tachycardia; the focus is on hypoxemia. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1 (高二酸化炭素血症) | 3 | Respiratory complication, fits context | 3 | Not mentioned, focus is hypoxemia |
| 2 (高血圧状態) | 2 | General anesthesia complication, less direct | 3 | Not mentioned, focus is hypoxemia |
| 3 (頻脈) | 2 | Possible secondary effect, less direct | 3 | Not mentioned, focus is hypoxemia |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are clearly incorrect for the specific prompt, as the sentence and triple focus on hypoxemia.
- Distractor 1 is the most plausible, as it is a direct respiratory complication.
- Distractors 2 and 3 are moderately plausible, as they are general intraoperative complications but less directly related to one-lung ventilation.
