sentence: dRTAに対するアルカリ剤の投与は尿中クエン酸排泄量の増加, 尿中カルシウム排泄量の低下等により有効であるとの理論的背景は明確にされているが臨床上もdRTAに伴う既存尿路結石の増大予防や新たな結石形成を長期にわたり予防しうることが証明された.
triple: {'subject': 'dRTAに対するアルカリ剤の投与', 'relation': 'は有効である', 'object': '既存尿路結石の増大予防および新たな結石形成の長期予防'}
question: dRTAに対するアルカリ剤の投与は、どのような尿路結石に関する予防に有効とされていますか？
distractor 1: 既存尿路結石の溶解および腎機能障害の改善
distractor 2: 新たな尿路感染症の予防および既存腎嚢胞の縮小
distractor 3: 尿中タンパク排泄量の減少および腎盂腎炎の再発予防

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 既存尿路結石の溶解および腎機能障害の改善  
("Dissolution of existing urinary stones and improvement of renal dysfunction")

### 1) Plausibility in Context  
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
- "既存尿路結石の溶解" (dissolution of existing stones) is related to the topic of urinary stones, which is plausible given the context of dRTA and alkali therapy.
- "腎機能障害の改善" (improvement of renal dysfunction) is a general renal benefit, which is somewhat plausible but not directly tied to the specific preventive effect described in the original sentence.
- Overall, the distractor is plausible in the biomedical context but not as tightly aligned with the specific preventive focus of the original answer.

### 2) Incorrectness  
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
- The original sentence and triple specify "prevention of increase in existing stones and long-term prevention of new stone formation," not dissolution or improvement of renal function.
- The distractor does not match the original object and is not supported by the sentence.

---

## Distractor 2: 新たな尿路感染症の予防および既存腎嚢胞の縮小  
("Prevention of new urinary tract infections and reduction of existing renal cysts")

### 1) Plausibility in Context  
**Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
- "新たな尿路感染症の予防" (prevention of new urinary tract infections) and "既存腎嚢胞の縮小" (reduction of existing renal cysts) are not directly related to urinary stones or dRTA.
- These are renal/urinary tract conditions, but the connection to alkali therapy for dRTA is weak and not supported by the context.

### 2) Incorrectness  
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
- The distractor is not supported by the original sentence or triple; it introduces unrelated conditions (UTI, renal cysts) that are not mentioned.

---

## Distractor 3: 尿中タンパク排泄量の減少および腎盂腎炎の再発予防  
("Reduction in urinary protein excretion and prevention of recurrent pyelonephritis")

### 1) Plausibility in Context  
**Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
- "尿中タンパク排泄量の減少" (reduction in urinary protein excretion) and "腎盂腎炎の再発予防" (prevention of recurrent pyelonephritis) are renal/urinary tract issues, but not directly related to urinary stones or the specific effects of alkali therapy in dRTA.
- The connection is weak and not supported by the context.

### 2) Incorrectness  
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
- The distractor is not supported by the original sentence or triple; it introduces unrelated outcomes (proteinuria, pyelonephritis) that are not mentioned.

# Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | 2 | Related to stones, but not prevention; plausible in context | 3 | Not supported by sentence/triple |
| 2 | 1 | Unrelated to stones/dRTA; weak connection | 3 | Not supported by sentence/triple |
| 3 | 1 | Unrelated to stones/dRTA; weak connection | 3 | Not supported by sentence/triple |

---

## Overall Reasoning
- Distractor 1 is the most plausible, as it at least mentions urinary stones, though it shifts the focus from prevention to dissolution and adds an unrelated benefit.
- Distractors 2 and 3 are barely plausible, as they mention renal/urinary conditions but are not relevant to the specific context of dRTA and alkali therapy for stone prevention.
- All distractors are definitely incorrect, as none match the original object or are supported by the sentence/triple.
