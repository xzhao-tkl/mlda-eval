sentence: 生細胞において、これら連結低分子はハンチントン病原因タンパク質を減少させた。
triple: {'subject': '連結低分子', 'relation': 'は生細胞において', 'object': 'ハンチントン病原因タンパク質を減少させた'}
question: 生細胞でハンチントン病原因タンパク質の量を減少させたのは何ですか？
distractor 1: 非連結低分子
distractor 2: 抗体医薬品
distractor 3: RNA干渉分子

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 非連結低分子 ("non-conjugated small molecules")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "非連結低分子" (non-conjugated small molecules) is a very plausible alternative to "連結低分子" (conjugated small molecules) in a biomedical context. Both are types of small molecules, and the difference is subtle. The distractor fits the expected answer type and could easily confuse someone, especially since the original sentence is about a specific type of small molecule.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically states that "連結低分子" (conjugated small molecules) reduced the protein, not "非連結低分子." Therefore, this distractor is clearly incorrect based on the sentence.

---

## Distractor 2: 抗体医薬品 ("antibody drugs")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "抗体医薬品" (antibody drugs) are a common biomedical intervention and could plausibly be considered as agents that reduce disease-related proteins. However, the original sentence is about small molecules, so this is less plausible than distractor 1 but still reasonable in the biomedical domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention antibody drugs at all; it only refers to small molecules. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: RNA干渉分子 ("RNA interference molecules")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** RNA interference molecules are a well-known method for reducing protein levels in cells, especially in research and therapeutic contexts. While plausible, the original sentence is about small molecules, so this is not as close as distractor 1 but still fits the domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention RNA interference molecules; it only refers to small molecules. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 非連結低分子        | 3            | Very similar to correct answer; fits context perfectly | 3             | Clearly not the agent described in the sentence |
| 抗体医薬品          | 2            | Common biomedical agent, but not as close as small molecules | 3             | Not mentioned in the sentence; definitely wrong |
| RNA干渉分子         | 2            | Known for reducing proteins, but not the focus here | 3             | Not mentioned in the sentence; definitely wrong |

## Overall Reasoning

- **Distractor 1** is the strongest, as it is highly plausible and definitely incorrect.
- **Distractors 2 and 3** are moderately plausible (fit the biomedical context but are not as close to the original subject) and definitely incorrect.

All distractors are valid and well-constructed for a biomedical multiple-choice question.
