triple: {'subject': '二重障害仮説（Wolf and Bowers, 1999）', 'relation': 'は発達性読み書き障害の原因となる認知障害として重要であるとする', 'object': '音韻認識障害に加えて呼称速度障害'}
question: 二重障害仮説（Wolf and Bowers, 1999）によれば、発達性読み書き障害の原因となる認知障害として音韻認識障害のほかに重要とされるのは何ですか？
distractor 1: 視覚認知障害
distractor 2: 注意欠陥障害
distractor 3: 記憶保持障害

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 視覚認知障害 (Visual cognitive impairment)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** In the context of developmental reading and writing disorders (dyslexia), visual cognitive impairment is a commonly discussed alternative hypothesis. It is a plausible candidate for a cognitive impairment that could be considered important, and experts might debate its role. It fits the biomedical/psychological domain and the expected answer type.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that, according to the double-deficit hypothesis, the important impairments are phonological awareness and naming speed, not visual cognitive impairment. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 注意欠陥障害 (Attention deficit disorder)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Attention deficit disorder is related to cognitive function and sometimes co-occurs with learning disabilities, but it is not typically cited as a primary cause of dyslexia in the double-deficit hypothesis. It is plausible in a general sense but less directly relevant than visual cognitive impairment.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention attention deficit disorder as a cause according to the double-deficit hypothesis, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 記憶保持障害 (Memory retention impairment)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Memory retention impairment is a cognitive issue and could theoretically affect learning, but it is not commonly associated with dyslexia or the double-deficit hypothesis. It is plausible in a broad cognitive context but less so in the specific context of reading disabilities.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention memory retention impairment as a cause according to the double-deficit hypothesis, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 視覚認知障害        | 3            | Common alternative hypothesis in dyslexia research; fits domain and context. | 3             | Not mentioned in the double-deficit hypothesis; clearly not the correct answer. |
| 注意欠陥障害        | 2            | Related to cognitive function, but less directly relevant to dyslexia. | 3             | Not mentioned in the double-deficit hypothesis; clearly not the correct answer. |
| 記憶保持障害        | 2            | General cognitive impairment, but not specifically linked to dyslexia. | 3             | Not mentioned in the double-deficit hypothesis; clearly not the correct answer. |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are clearly incorrect according to the original sentence and triple, earning a score of 3 for incorrectness. For plausibility, "視覚認知障害" is the most convincing distractor, as it is a well-known alternative hypothesis in dyslexia research. The other two are plausible in a general cognitive context but less so in the specific context of the double-deficit hypothesis. None of the distractors are implausible or irrelevant.
