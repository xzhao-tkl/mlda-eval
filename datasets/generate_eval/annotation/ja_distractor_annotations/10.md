sentence: 腎盂腫瘍については, Low grade群 (G1+G2) の5年実測生存率は77%であるのに対し, High grade群 (G3+G4) で36%であり, また, High grade群では手術療法単独群の予後が良好であつた.
triple: {'subject': '腎盂腫瘍のHigh grade群 (G3+G4)', 'relation': 'における5年実測生存率は', 'object': '36%であり、手術療法単独群の予後が良好であった'}
question: 腎盂腫瘍で5年実測生存率が36%となり、手術療法単独群の予後が良好であったのはどのグレード群ですか？
distractor 1: Low grade群 (G1+G2)
distractor 2: 全症例群 (G1〜G4)
distractor 3: 未分化群 (G4のみ)

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: Low grade群 (G1+G2)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "Low grade群 (G1+G2)" is a standard classification in tumor grading and is directly contrasted with "High grade群 (G3+G4)" in the sentence. It is a very plausible answer for someone who might confuse the groups, especially since the sentence mentions both. It fits the expected answer type and domain perfectly.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence clearly states that the 5-year survival rate for Low grade群 is 77%, not 36%, and does not mention the prognosis for surgical therapy in this group. Therefore, it is definitely incorrect for the prompt.

---

## Distractor 2: 全症例群 (G1〜G4)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "全症例群 (G1〜G4)" means "all cases (G1 to G4)." While this is a plausible grouping in medical studies, the prompt specifically asks for a grade group with a 36% survival rate and good prognosis with surgery, which is not typically reported for the entire group. However, someone unfamiliar with the details might consider this plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not provide survival rates or prognosis for the entire group (G1〜G4), only for the specific subgroups. Thus, this is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 未分化群 (G4のみ)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "未分化群 (G4のみ)" means "undifferentiated group (G4 only)." This is a plausible distractor because G4 is part of the High grade group, and someone might think the statistics apply to G4 alone. However, the prompt refers to G3+G4, not just G4, so it's not a perfect fit.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 2 (Likely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence gives data for G3+G4, not G4 alone. While G4 is included in the High grade group, the statistics do not apply to G4 only, making this likely but not absolutely incorrect (since G4 is part of the group).

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| Low grade群 (G1+G2) | 3 | Standard group, plausible confusion | 3 | Clearly not matching the sentence data |
| 全症例群 (G1〜G4) | 2 | Possible grouping, but not specific | 3 | No data for this group in sentence |
| 未分化群 (G4のみ) | 2 | Related subgroup, but not exact | 2 | Not the group described, but overlaps |

---

## Overall Reasoning
- **Distractor 1** is the strongest distractor, both plausible and definitely incorrect.
- **Distractor 2** is moderately plausible, but definitely incorrect.
- **Distractor 3** is moderately plausible and likely incorrect, but not as strong as Distractor 1.

All distractors are relevant and domain-appropriate, with varying degrees of plausibility and incorrectness.
