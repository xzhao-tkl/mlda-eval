sentence: そのため特に虚血例では,PCPSの開始とともに早期の血行再建が必要であると考えられた。
triple: {'subject': '虚血例でPCPSを開始した場合', 'relation': '必要とされるのは', 'object': '早期の血行再建'}
question: PCPSを開始した際に早期の血行再建が必要とされるのはどのような症例ですか？
distractor 1: 出血例
distractor 2: 感染例
distractor 3: 心不全例

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 出血例 (Hemorrhagic case)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "出血例" (hemorrhagic case) is a plausible biomedical scenario where PCPS (percutaneous cardiopulmonary support) might be considered. However, the need for "早期の血行再建" (early revascularization) is less directly associated with hemorrhage than with ischemia. Still, it is not completely out of context, as severe bleeding can sometimes require vascular intervention, but not typically "revascularization" in the sense used here.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that "虚血例" (ischemic case) is the scenario requiring early revascularization when PCPS is started. "出血例" is not supported by the sentence and is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 感染例 (Infectious case)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "感染例" (infectious case) is a plausible medical scenario, and PCPS might be used in severe sepsis or septic shock. However, the need for "early revascularization" is not typically associated with infection, making it less plausible than ischemia but still within the biomedical context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not support infection as the scenario requiring early revascularization with PCPS. It is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 心不全例 (Heart failure case)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "心不全例" (heart failure case) is a very plausible distractor. PCPS is often used in severe heart failure, and early revascularization may sometimes be considered, especially if the heart failure is due to ischemia. This could confuse even experts, as the distinction between ischemic and non-ischemic heart failure is subtle.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 2 (Likely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** While heart failure is plausible, the original sentence specifically refers to "虚血例" (ischemic case) as the scenario requiring early revascularization. Heart failure is not explicitly supported, but there is some ambiguity if the heart failure is ischemic in origin. Thus, it is likely wrong, but not as clear-cut as the other distractors.

## Summary Table

| Distractor      | Plausibility (Score, Reason) | Incorrectness (Score, Reason) |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 出血例          | 2: Moderately plausible; fits domain, but not typical for revascularization | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by sentence |
| 感染例          | 2: Moderately plausible; fits domain, but not typical for revascularization | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by sentence |
| 心不全例        | 3: Highly plausible; could confuse experts, fits context well | 2: Likely wrong; not supported, but some ambiguity if ischemic heart failure |

---

## Reasoning Summary

- **出血例** and **感染例** are plausible in a biomedical context but not typically associated with early revascularization, making them moderately plausible and definitely incorrect.
- **心不全例** is highly plausible due to its close association with PCPS and possible need for revascularization, but it is not the scenario specified in the sentence, making it likely (but not definitely) incorrect. This distractor is the strongest in terms of plausibility and could potentially confuse even experts.
