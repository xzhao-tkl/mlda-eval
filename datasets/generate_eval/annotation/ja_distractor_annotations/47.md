sentence: 次に公的検診非対象者である若年成人層はH. pylori除菌による胃がん予防効果が高いことから,県内全20市町中13市町でH. pylori検査補助などが行われている。
triple: {'subject': '若年成人層におけるH. pylori除菌', 'relation': 'は', 'object': '胃がん予防効果が高い'}
question: H. pylori除菌による胃がん予防効果が高いとされるのはどのような層ですか？
distractor 1: 高齢者層
distractor 2: 小児層
distractor 3: 妊婦層

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 高齢者層 (elderly population)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** In biomedical contexts, elderly populations are often considered for cancer prevention strategies. The question asks about a "層" (group) for which H. pylori eradication is effective for gastric cancer prevention. "高齢者層" fits the expected answer type and is a plausible candidate, as elderly are at risk for gastric cancer, making this a convincing distractor.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically states that the effect is high in "若年成人層" (young adults), not elderly. Thus, "高齢者層" is clearly incorrect for this context.

---

## Distractor 2: 小児層 (children)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Children are a recognized population in medical screening and prevention, but they are less commonly associated with gastric cancer risk or H. pylori eradication for cancer prevention. Still, the distractor fits the expected answer type and is not out of place, though less plausible than elderly.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention children as a group with high preventive effect from H. pylori eradication. Therefore, this is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 妊婦層 (pregnant women)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Pregnant women are a medically relevant group, but not typically associated with gastric cancer prevention via H. pylori eradication. The distractor fits the grammatical and contextual requirements, but is less plausible than elderly.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention pregnant women as a target group for H. pylori eradication for gastric cancer prevention. Thus, this is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor      | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| 高齢者層        | 3           | Fits domain, plausible   | 3            | Not the group in sentence|
| 小児層          | 2           | Less common, but possible| 3            | Not mentioned in sentence|
| 妊婦層          | 2           | Relevant group, less likely| 3            | Not mentioned in sentence|

## Overall Reasoning

All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence, which specifies "若年成人層" as the group with high preventive effect. "高齢者層" is the most plausible distractor, as elderly are often considered in cancer prevention, while "小児層" and "妊婦層" are less plausible but still reasonable in a biomedical context. None are awkward or irrelevant, and all are grammatically correct.
