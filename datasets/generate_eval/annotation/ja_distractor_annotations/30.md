sentence: そして内熱が実熱証に属すか,虚熱証に属すかで脈候,腹候の虚実,食思の程度が異なる。
triple: {'subject': '内熱が実熱証に属するか虚熱証に属するか', 'relation': 'によって', 'object': '脈候、腹候の虚実、食思の程度が異なる'}
question: 脈候や腹候の虚実、食思の程度が異なるのは、何が実熱証か虚熱証かによってですか？
distractor 1: 外寒が表証に属するか裏証に属するか
distractor 2: 湿熱が肝に属するか脾に属するか
distractor 3: 気虚が肺に属するか腎に属するか

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 外寒が表証に属するか裏証に属するか  
("Whether external cold belongs to exterior syndrome or interior syndrome")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The distractor is plausible in the context of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) terminology, as "外寒" (external cold), "表証" (exterior syndrome), and "裏証" (interior syndrome) are all relevant concepts.
  - However, the original sentence is about "内熱" (internal heat) and its classification as "実熱証" (excess heat syndrome) or "虚熱証" (deficiency heat syndrome), which is a different pathological process than external cold.
  - The distractor fits the expected answer type (a dichotomous classification), but the subject matter is not directly related to the original sentence, making it moderately plausible but not highly so.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The original sentence clearly states that the difference in pulse, abdominal signs, and appetite is due to whether internal heat is excess or deficiency type.
  - "外寒が表証に属するか裏証に属するか" is not supported by the sentence and is definitely not the correct answer.

## Distractor 2: 湿熱が肝に属するか脾に属するか  
("Whether damp-heat belongs to the liver or spleen")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - "湿熱" (damp-heat), "肝" (liver), and "脾" (spleen) are all valid TCM concepts, and the classification of syndromes by organ is common.
  - The structure of the distractor matches the original prompt (classification of a syndrome by organ).
  - However, the original sentence is about the classification of "内熱" (internal heat) by excess/deficiency, not by organ, so while plausible in a general TCM context, it is not highly plausible for this specific sentence.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The original sentence does not mention damp-heat or organ classification; it is about excess/deficiency of internal heat.
  - This distractor is definitely incorrect for the given sentence.

## Distractor 3: 気虚が肺に属するか腎に属するか  
("Whether qi deficiency belongs to the lung or kidney")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - "気虚" (qi deficiency), "肺" (lung), and "腎" (kidney) are all relevant TCM concepts, and classification by organ is common.
  - The distractor fits the expected answer type and is plausible in a general TCM context.
  - However, the original sentence is about internal heat and its excess/deficiency, not qi deficiency or organ classification, so it is only moderately plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The original sentence is not about qi deficiency or organ classification, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | 2 | TCM concepts, fits answer type, but not about internal heat | 3 | Not supported by sentence, clearly wrong |
| 2 | 2 | TCM concepts, fits answer type, but not about internal heat | 3 | Not supported by sentence, clearly wrong |
| 3 | 2 | TCM concepts, fits answer type, but not about internal heat | 3 | Not supported by sentence, clearly wrong |

## Overall Reasoning

All distractors are moderately plausible because they use valid TCM concepts and fit the expected answer type (classification by dichotomy), but none are highly plausible because they do not directly relate to the subject of the original sentence (internal heat and its excess/deficiency). All are definitely incorrect, as none are supported by the original sentence or triple.
