sentence: ステロイド関節症の発症にはステロイド量,回数,期間の以外に基礎疾患,骨の脆弱性,外力などの要因が存在する.
triple: {'subject': 'ステロイド関節症の発症', 'relation': 'には影響する要因として', 'object': 'ステロイド量、回数、期間以外に基礎疾患、骨の脆弱性、外力が存在する'}
question: ステロイド関節症の発症において、ステロイド量・回数・期間以外に影響する要因として挙げられるものは何ですか？
distractor 1: 年齢、性別、生活習慣
distractor 2: 感染症、免疫反応、栄養状態
distractor 3: 運動不足、肥満、遺伝的要因

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1: 年齢、性別、生活習慣 (Age, Sex, Lifestyle Habits)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** These factors are commonly considered as risk factors or influencing factors in the development of many diseases, including joint disorders. In the biomedical context, age, sex, and lifestyle habits are often discussed as relevant to disease onset and progression. They fit the expected answer type (factors other than steroid dose/frequency/duration) and are plausible in the context of the question.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically lists "基礎疾患、骨の脆弱性、外力" (underlying disease, bone fragility, external force) as the correct factors, and does not mention age, sex, or lifestyle habits. Therefore, this distractor is clearly incorrect based on the given sentence and triple.

---

## Distractor 2: 感染症、免疫反応、栄養状態 (Infection, Immune Response, Nutritional Status)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** These are all biomedical factors that could plausibly influence the onset of steroid arthropathy. They are relevant in the context of disease risk factors and fit the expected answer type. Experts might consider these as possible influences, making them convincing distractors.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention infection, immune response, or nutritional status as influencing factors. The correct answer is limited to underlying disease, bone fragility, and external force. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 運動不足、肥満、遺伝的要因 (Lack of Exercise, Obesity, Genetic Factors)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** These are well-known risk factors for many musculoskeletal and joint diseases. In the biomedical context, they are plausible as influencing factors for the onset of steroid arthropathy, fitting the expected answer type and domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention lack of exercise, obesity, or genetic factors. The correct answer is specifically underlying disease, bone fragility, and external force. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score/Reason) | Incorrectness (Score/Reason) |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1 (年齢、性別、生活習慣) | 3: Highly plausible; common biomedical risk factors | 3: Definitely wrong; not listed in original sentence |
| 2 (感染症、免疫反応、栄養状態) | 3: Highly plausible; relevant biomedical factors | 3: Definitely wrong; not listed in original sentence |
| 3 (運動不足、肥満、遺伝的要因) | 3: Highly plausible; fits disease risk context | 3: Definitely wrong; not listed in original sentence |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
All three distractors are highly plausible in the biomedical context and fit the expected answer type for the question. None of them are mentioned in the original sentence or triple, making them definitely incorrect as answers. These distractors are well-constructed and would be effective in a multiple-choice setting.
