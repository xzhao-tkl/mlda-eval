sentence: 人工血管表面のフィブリン形成や血小板の粘着も抑制された。
triple: {'subject': '人工血管表面', 'relation': 'で抑制されるのは', 'object': 'フィブリン形成と血小板の粘着'}
question: 人工血管表面で抑制される現象として挙げられるのは何ですか？
distractor 1: 赤血球の溶解と白血球の遊走
distractor 2: 血漿タンパクの沈着と好中球の活性化
distractor 3: コラーゲンの沈着とマクロファージの集積

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 赤血球の溶解と白血球の遊走 (Hemolysis of red blood cells and migration of white blood cells)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Both hemolysis and leukocyte migration are phenomena that can occur in blood-contacting medical devices, and are relevant in the biomedical context. However, they are not the most typical or expected phenomena to be suppressed on artificial blood vessel surfaces compared to fibrin formation and platelet adhesion. Still, they are plausible enough to be considered by someone with basic biomedical knowledge.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence clearly states that "fibrin formation and platelet adhesion" are suppressed, not hemolysis or leukocyte migration. There is no mention or implication that these phenomena are suppressed, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Distractor 2: 血漿タンパクの沈着と好中球の活性化 (Deposition of plasma proteins and activation of neutrophils)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Plasma protein deposition and neutrophil activation are both highly relevant to the context of artificial blood vessel surfaces. These are common concerns in biomaterial science and could reasonably be considered as phenomena to be suppressed. This distractor could easily confuse even experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention plasma protein deposition or neutrophil activation as suppressed phenomena. The only phenomena stated as suppressed are fibrin formation and platelet adhesion, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: コラーゲンの沈着とマクロファージの集積 (Collagen deposition and macrophage accumulation)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Collagen deposition and macrophage accumulation are related to tissue response and inflammation, which can occur with implanted biomaterials. However, these are more associated with chronic responses or tissue remodeling, not acute blood-contact phenomena like fibrin formation and platelet adhesion. Thus, they are plausible but less so than distractor 2.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention suppression of collagen deposition or macrophage accumulation. The only phenomena suppressed are fibrin formation and platelet adhesion, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | Relevant but less typical for blood vessel surface | 3 | Not mentioned, definitely wrong |
| 2 | 3 | Highly relevant, could confuse experts | 3 | Not mentioned, definitely wrong |
| 3 | 2 | Related to biomaterial response, less acute | 3 | Not mentioned, definitely wrong |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are clearly incorrect as per the original sentence and triple. Distractor 2 is the most plausible in context, while 1 and 3 are moderately plausible but less directly related to the acute blood-contact phenomena described. None of the distractors are ambiguous or partially correct based on the sentence.
