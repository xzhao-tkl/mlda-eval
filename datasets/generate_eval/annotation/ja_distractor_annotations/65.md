sentence: リピドミクスは試料中に含まれる脂質の総体を研究対象とする学問分野である。
triple: {'subject': 'リピドミクス', 'relation': 'は研究対象とする学問分野である', 'object': '試料中に含まれる脂質の総体'}
question: リピドミクスが研究対象とするのは試料中の何の総体ですか？
distractor 1: 試料中に含まれるタンパク質の総体
distractor 2: 試料中に含まれる核酸の総体
distractor 3: 試料中に含まれる糖質の総体

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 試料中に含まれるタンパク質の総体 (Total proteins contained in the sample)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "タンパク質" (proteins) are a major class of biomolecules, and studying the total proteins in a sample is the focus of "プロテオミクス" (proteomics), which is a field closely related to "リピドミクス" (lipidomics). The distractor fits the expected answer type and is a convincing alternative in the biomedical context.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence clearly states that "リピドミクス" studies the total lipids, not proteins. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect for the given sentence.

## Distractor 2: 試料中に含まれる核酸の総体 (Total nucleic acids contained in the sample)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "核酸" (nucleic acids) are another major biomolecule class, and their study is the focus of "ゲノミクス" (genomics) or "トランスクリプトミクス" (transcriptomics). This distractor is plausible and fits the domain and context well.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence specifies lipids, not nucleic acids, as the research target of "リピドミクス." This distractor is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 試料中に含まれる糖質の総体 (Total carbohydrates contained in the sample)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "糖質" (carbohydrates) are also a major biomolecule class, and their study is called "グリコミクス" (glycomics). This distractor is plausible and fits the context and expected answer type.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence is about lipids, not carbohydrates. This distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| タンパク質 | 3 | Major biomolecule, fits context, plausible alternative | 3 | Clearly not the correct answer per sentence |
| 核酸 | 3 | Major biomolecule, fits context, plausible alternative | 3 | Clearly not the correct answer per sentence |
| 糖質 | 3 | Major biomolecule, fits context, plausible alternative | 3 | Clearly not the correct answer per sentence |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All three distractors are highly plausible in the biomedical context, as they represent major classes of biomolecules that are commonly studied in similar "-omics" fields. They are all definitely incorrect for the given sentence, which specifies lipids as the research target of "リピドミクス." These distractors are well-designed and would be challenging for test-takers familiar with the domain.
