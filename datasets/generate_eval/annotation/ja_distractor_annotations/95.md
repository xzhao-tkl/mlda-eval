sentence: 出血コントロール目的に残胃全摘術を行い,病理検査で肺癌の胃転移と診断された.
triple: {'subject': '残胃全摘術', 'relation': 'は出血コントロール目的で施行され', 'object': '病理検査で肺癌の胃転移と診断された'}
question: 出血コントロールを目的として施行された手術は何ですか？
distractor 1: 胃部分切除術
distractor 2: 胃バイパス術
distractor 3: 胃粘膜切除術

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 胃部分切除術 (Partial gastrectomy)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "胃部分切除術" is a common surgical procedure for gastric issues, including bleeding control. It is very similar to "残胃全摘術" (total gastrectomy of the remnant stomach), and could easily be confused in a clinical context. The subject, relation, and expected answer type (a surgical procedure) all fit well.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifies "残胃全摘術" (total gastrectomy of the remnant stomach), not "胃部分切除術" (partial gastrectomy). The distractor is clearly incorrect based on the sentence and triple.

---

## Distractor 2: 胃バイパス術 (Gastric bypass surgery)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "胃バイパス術" is a recognized surgical procedure, but it is less commonly performed specifically for bleeding control compared to gastrectomy procedures. It fits the domain and is a plausible answer, but a clinician would likely rule it out based on typical indications.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention "胃バイパス術" and specifies "残胃全摘術." Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 胃粘膜切除術 (Endoscopic mucosal resection)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "胃粘膜切除術" is a procedure for removing mucosal lesions, often used for early-stage cancers or polyps. It is less likely to be used for bleeding control in the context of metastatic lung cancer to the stomach, but it is still a recognized procedure in the domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifies a much more extensive surgery ("残胃全摘術"), not a mucosal resection. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 胃部分切除術 | 3 | Very similar procedure, fits context well | 3 | Clearly not the procedure performed |
| 胃バイパス術 | 2 | Recognized surgery, less typical for bleeding control | 3 | Not mentioned, not the correct answer |
| 胃粘膜切除術 | 2 | Recognized, but less plausible for this indication | 3 | Not the procedure performed |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are incorrect, as none match the procedure described in the original sentence. "胃部分切除術" is the most plausible distractor, as it is very similar to the correct answer and could easily confuse even experts. The other two are plausible but less likely given the clinical context. All are definitely incorrect based on the original sentence and triple.
