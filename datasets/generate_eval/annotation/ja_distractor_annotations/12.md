sentence: 多脾症は非常に稀な疾患で,先天性心疾患や内臓奇形を合併し,重篤な心疾患のない5-10 %のみが成人できるとされる.
triple: {'subject': '多脾症', 'relation': 'は合併することが多い', 'object': '先天性心疾患や内臓奇形'}
question: 多脾症が合併しやすい疾患や奇形には何がありますか？
distractor 1: 後天性心疾患や骨格奇形
distractor 2: 先天性腎疾患や消化管奇形
distractor 3: 免疫不全症や神経奇形

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 後天性心疾患や骨格奇形 (Acquired heart disease and skeletal malformations)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - "後天性心疾患" (acquired heart disease) is plausible as a disease type, but the original sentence specifically mentions "先天性心疾患" (congenital heart disease), which is a different category. "骨格奇形" (skeletal malformations) is a plausible type of malformation, though not mentioned in the original sentence. Both are biomedical terms and could be considered as possible comorbidities, but the shift from congenital to acquired is a notable difference that makes it less plausible.
  
### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The original triple states "先天性心疾患や内臓奇形" (congenital heart disease and visceral malformations) are commonly associated. "後天性心疾患" is not mentioned and is a different category, and "骨格奇形" is not listed. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Distractor 2: 先天性腎疾患や消化管奇形 (Congenital kidney disease and gastrointestinal malformations)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - "先天性腎疾患" (congenital kidney disease) and "消化管奇形" (gastrointestinal malformations) are both plausible comorbidities in the context of congenital syndromes and malformations. They fit the expected answer type and domain, and could easily confuse even experts as they are similar to the correct answer.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The original sentence and triple do not mention kidney or gastrointestinal malformations; only heart and visceral (internal organ) malformations are specified. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 免疫不全症や神経奇形 (Immunodeficiency and neural malformations)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - "免疫不全症" (immunodeficiency) and "神経奇形" (neural malformations) are plausible biomedical conditions, but they are less commonly associated with polysplenia (多脾症) compared to heart and visceral malformations. They are relevant in the biomedical domain but less likely to be confused with the correct answer.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The original sentence and triple do not mention immunodeficiency or neural malformations. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | 2 | Biomedical terms, but "acquired" vs "congenital" is a notable shift; skeletal malformations plausible but not mentioned. | 3 | Not mentioned in the original sentence/triple. |
| 2 | 3 | Very plausible, similar congenital malformations, fits domain and could confuse experts. | 3 | Not mentioned in the original sentence/triple. |
| 3 | 2 | Plausible biomedical conditions, but less commonly associated with polysplenia. | 3 | Not mentioned in the original sentence/triple. |

---

## Overall Reasoning

- All distractors are **incorrect** as per the original sentence and triple.
- Distractor 2 is the most plausible, as it closely matches the expected answer type and domain.
- Distractors 1 and 3 are moderately plausible, but have domain or context shifts that make them less convincing.
