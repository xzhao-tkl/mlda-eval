sentence: 腫瘍最小線量は腫瘍壁厚と相関しており, 腫瘍最小線量が高い症例は局所再発が抑えられる可能性が示唆された.
triple: {'subject': '腫瘍最小線量', 'relation': 'は相関している', 'object': '腫瘍壁厚'}
question: 腫瘍最小線量が相関しているのはどのような腫瘍の特徴ですか？
distractor 1: 腫瘍の大きさ
distractor 2: 腫瘍の形状
distractor 3: 腫瘍の血流量

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 腫瘍の大きさ (Tumor size)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "腫瘍最小線量" (minimum tumor dose) could reasonably be expected to correlate with "腫瘍の大きさ" (tumor size) in biomedical contexts. Size is a common tumor characteristic considered in dose planning, and the question asks about "腫瘍の特徴" (tumor characteristics), making this a very convincing distractor.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original triple states the correlation is with "腫瘍壁厚" (tumor wall thickness), not size. There is no mention of size in the sentence or triple, so this is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 腫瘍の形状 (Tumor shape)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Shape is a relevant tumor characteristic in biomedical contexts, and could conceivably affect dose distribution. However, it's less directly related to dose calculation than size or wall thickness, making it somewhat plausible but not as strong as size.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not mention shape at all; the correlation is specifically with wall thickness. Thus, this is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 腫瘍の血流量 (Tumor blood flow)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Blood flow is a biomedical characteristic that can affect treatment response, but is less likely to be directly correlated with minimum dose in standard radiotherapy contexts. It is plausible but not highly so.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention blood flow; the correlation is with wall thickness. This is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1 (大きさ) | 3 | Very plausible; size is a common tumor feature for dose correlation. | 3 | Clearly not the answer; not mentioned in the sentence/triple. |
| 2 (形状)   | 2 | Somewhat plausible; shape is relevant but less direct. | 3 | Clearly not the answer; not mentioned in the sentence/triple. |
| 3 (血流量) | 2 | Somewhat plausible; blood flow is a biomedical feature but less related. | 3 | Clearly not the answer; not mentioned in the sentence/triple. |

---

## Overall Reasoning

- All distractors are **incorrect** (score 3) because none are supported by the original sentence or triple.
- **Plausibility** is highest for "腫瘍の大きさ" (size), as it is a very common and relevant feature in dose planning, making it a strong distractor. "形状" (shape) and "血流量" (blood flow) are plausible but less directly related, so they score 2.
- None of the distractors are implausible or irrelevant; all are reasonable biomedical features, but only "腫瘍壁厚" (wall thickness) is correct per the original data.
