sentence: 非糖尿病肥満者ではブドウ糖負荷時に血中インスリンの過剰反応があり, 体重の減少により正常化することが知られている.
triple: {'subject': '非糖尿病肥満者', 'relation': 'ではブドウ糖負荷時に', 'object': '血中インスリンの過剰反応がみられ、体重の減少により正常化する'}
question: 非糖尿病肥満者がブドウ糖負荷時に示し、体重の減少によって正常化する反応は何ですか？
distractor 1: 血中グルコースの低下反応
distractor 2: 血中コレステロールの上昇反応
distractor 3: 血中グルカゴンの過剰反応

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 血中グルコースの低下反応 (Decrease in blood glucose response)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The question is about a physiological response in obese non-diabetic individuals during a glucose load, which is a standard test for glucose metabolism.
  - "Decrease in blood glucose" is a plausible answer type in this context, as glucose levels are measured during such tests.
  - However, the original sentence specifically discusses "excessive insulin response," not glucose decrease. Still, the distractor is plausible because glucose is directly related to the test.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The original sentence states that the abnormality is in insulin response, not glucose levels.
  - "Decrease in blood glucose" is not supported by the sentence; in fact, insulin excess would typically lower glucose, but the abnormality described is in insulin, not glucose.

## Distractor 2: 血中コレステロールの上昇反応 (Increase in blood cholesterol response)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - Cholesterol is not directly related to glucose tolerance tests or the acute response to glucose loading.
  - While cholesterol is a metabolic marker, it is not typically measured or discussed in the context of glucose load tests.
  - This distractor is only tangentially related to the domain (metabolism), but not to the specific context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The original sentence does not mention cholesterol at all.
  - There is no support for cholesterol response being the abnormality that normalizes with weight loss in this context.

---

## Distractor 3: 血中グルカゴンの過剰反応 (Excessive blood glucagon response)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - Glucagon is a hormone involved in glucose metabolism and is sometimes measured in glucose tolerance tests.
  - An "excessive glucagon response" could be a plausible abnormal reaction in metabolic disorders, making this distractor convincing for someone with biomedical knowledge.
  - It fits the expected answer type (a hormonal response) and the context of the question.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The original sentence specifically states "excessive insulin response," not glucagon.
  - There is no mention of glucagon in the sentence, so this is clearly incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1. 血中グルコースの低下反応 | 2 | Related to glucose load, plausible but not the abnormality described | 3 | Not supported by sentence, abnormality is insulin |
| 2. 血中コレステロールの上昇反応 | 1 | Only tangentially related, not plausible in glucose load context | 3 | Not mentioned or supported by sentence |
| 3. 血中グルカゴンの過剰反応 | 3 | Hormonal response, fits context, could confuse experts | 3 | Not supported by sentence, abnormality is insulin |

## Final Reasoning Summary

- **Distractor 1** is moderately plausible due to its relation to glucose metabolism, but clearly incorrect.
- **Distractor 2** is barely plausible, as cholesterol is not relevant to the context, and definitely incorrect.
- **Distractor 3** is highly plausible and could confuse even experts, but is definitely incorrect based on the sentence. 

This set of distractors is well-constructed, with a good mix of plausibility and clear incorrectness.
