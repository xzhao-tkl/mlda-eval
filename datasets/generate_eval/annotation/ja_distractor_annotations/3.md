sentence: PEHは気管支鏡やCTガイド下肺生検では確定診断を得ることは困難であり,外科的肺生検が診断に有用となることが多いと考える.
triple: {'subject': 'PEHの診断', 'relation': 'に有用な方法は', 'object': '外科的肺生検'}
question: PEHの確定診断を得るために有用とされる検査方法は何ですか？
distractor 1: 気管支鏡検査
distractor 2: CTガイド下肺生検
distractor 3: 喀痰細胞診

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 気管支鏡検査

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** 気管支鏡検査 (bronchoscopy) is a standard diagnostic tool for lung diseases and is mentioned in the original sentence as a method attempted for PEH diagnosis. It fits the expected answer type (diagnostic method) and is plausible in the biomedical context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence explicitly states that bronchoscopy is *not* sufficient for a definitive diagnosis of PEH, making it clearly incorrect as the answer to the prompt.

---

## Distractor 2: CTガイド下肺生検

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** CT-guided lung biopsy is a common and advanced diagnostic procedure for lung lesions. It is mentioned in the sentence as a method used for PEH diagnosis, making it a very plausible distractor.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence states that CT-guided lung biopsy is also insufficient for definitive diagnosis of PEH, so it is clearly incorrect for the prompt.

---

## Distractor 3: 喀痰細胞診

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** 喀痰細胞診 (sputum cytology) is a diagnostic method for some lung diseases, but is less commonly used for rare tumors like PEH. It is plausible as a diagnostic method, but less convincing than the first two distractors.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention sputum cytology and, by domain knowledge, it is not useful for diagnosing PEH, making it definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 気管支鏡検査         | 3            | Standard method, mentioned in sentence, fits context | 3             | Explicitly stated as not useful for definitive diagnosis |
| CTガイド下肺生検     | 3            | Advanced method, mentioned in sentence, fits context | 3             | Explicitly stated as not useful for definitive diagnosis |
| 喀痰細胞診           | 2            | Plausible but less commonly used for PEH, not mentioned | 3             | Not useful for PEH, not mentioned, domain knowledge confirms incorrectness |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are plausible diagnostic methods in the biomedical context, with the first two being highly plausible due to their mention in the sentence and common use for lung disease diagnosis. All are definitely incorrect for the specific case of PEH definitive diagnosis, as per the original sentence and domain knowledge. The third distractor is slightly less plausible but still reasonable.
