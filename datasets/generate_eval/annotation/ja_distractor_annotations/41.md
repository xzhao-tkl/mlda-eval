sentence: エレクトロポレーション (EP) 法は細胞に電気パルスを与えることにより細胞内への化学物質やDNAの取り込みを増強させる方法であり、ブレオマイシン (BLM) などの抗癌剤との併用 (電気化学療法) により薬剤の抗腫瘍効果を高めることが知られている。
triple: {'subject': 'エレクトロポレーション法とブレオマイシンなどの抗癌剤の併用', 'relation': 'により', 'object': '薬剤の抗腫瘍効果が高まる'}
question: 薬剤の抗腫瘍効果を高めることが知られているのはどのような治療法の併用ですか？
distractor 1: 化学療法単独
distractor 2: 放射線療法と抗癌剤の併用
distractor 3: 免疫療法と分子標的薬の併用

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 化学療法単独 (Chemotherapy alone)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Chemotherapy is a standard cancer treatment, and "単独" (alone) is a plausible answer type for a question about treatment methods. However, the prompt specifically asks about a combination therapy, so "単独" is less plausible than a combination, but still fits the biomedical context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence clearly states that the increased antitumor effect is known for the *combination* of electroporation and anticancer drugs, not for chemotherapy alone. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 放射線療法と抗癌剤の併用 (Combination of radiation therapy and anticancer drugs)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** This is a very plausible distractor. Combination therapies are common in oncology, and radiation plus anticancer drugs is a well-known regimen. It fits the expected answer type and could easily confuse even experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention radiation therapy; it specifically refers to electroporation and anticancer drugs. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect for the given context.

---

## Distractor 3: 免疫療法と分子標的薬の併用 (Combination of immunotherapy and molecular targeted drugs)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** This is another highly plausible distractor. Immunotherapy and molecular targeted drugs are modern cancer treatments often used in combination. The distractor fits the biomedical context and the expected answer type.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention immunotherapy or molecular targeted drugs; it is about electroporation and anticancer drugs. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1. 化学療法単独 | 2 | Standard treatment, but not a combination as asked | 3 | Clearly not the combination described in the sentence |
| 2. 放射線療法と抗癌剤の併用 | 3 | Common combination, fits context, could confuse experts | 3 | Not mentioned in the sentence, definitely wrong |
| 3. 免疫療法と分子標的薬の併用 | 3 | Modern combination, fits context, could confuse experts | 3 | Not mentioned in the sentence, definitely wrong |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are incorrect for the original sentence, but distractors 2 and 3 are especially strong because they are highly plausible and fit the biomedical context well.
- Distractor 1 is less plausible because the question asks about a combination, but it is still a reasonable distractor.
- None of the distractors are ambiguous or partially correct; all are clearly incorrect for the specific context described.
