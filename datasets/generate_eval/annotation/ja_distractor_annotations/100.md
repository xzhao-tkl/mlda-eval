sentence: アクチノマイシンD, DNaseでは阻害されず,RNase,ピロリン酸で強く阻害される:誘導期をもたず,少なくとも2時間は直線的に進行し,その速度は添加したウイルス量に比例する。
triple: {'subject': 'ウイルス添加による反応の進行', 'relation': 'は阻害される', 'object': 'RNaseおよびピロリン酸'}
question: ウイルス添加による反応の進行を強く阻害するのはどの物質ですか？
distractor 1: アクチノマイシンDおよびDNase
distractor 2: プロテアーゼおよびEDTA
distractor 3: DNAポリメラーゼおよびATP

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1: アクチノマイシンDおよびDNase

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Reasoning:** Both アクチノマイシンD (Actinomycin D) and DNase are well-known biochemical agents. Actinomycin D inhibits transcription, and DNase degrades DNA. The sentence explicitly states that the reaction is **not inhibited** by these agents, but in a biomedical context, they are plausible candidates for inhibition, especially if the reader is not paying close attention to the specific details.
- **Score:** **2** (Moderately plausible: They are reasonable inhibitors in general, but the sentence rules them out.)

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence clearly states that the reaction is **not inhibited** by Actinomycin D or DNase. Therefore, this distractor is definitely wrong.
- **Score:** **3** (Definitely wrong: Contradicts the original sentence.)

## Distractor 2: プロテアーゼおよびEDTA

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Reasoning:** プロテアーゼ (protease) and EDTA are common laboratory reagents. Protease degrades proteins, and EDTA chelates metal ions, often used to inhibit enzymes that require metal cofactors. While neither is mentioned in the sentence, both could plausibly inhibit some biochemical reactions, making them reasonable distractors in a biomedical context.
- **Score:** **2** (Moderately plausible: They fit the domain and could be considered inhibitors, but are not mentioned in the sentence.)

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention protease or EDTA as inhibitors of the reaction. There is no evidence in the sentence to support their inhibitory effect, so they are definitely wrong.
- **Score:** **3** (Definitely wrong: Not supported by the sentence.)

---

## Distractor 3: DNAポリメラーゼおよびATP

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Reasoning:** DNAポリメラーゼ (DNA polymerase) is an enzyme that synthesizes DNA, and ATP is a universal energy molecule. While these are important in many biochemical reactions, they are not typically inhibitors. However, in a multiple-choice setting, they could be plausible to someone who is not familiar with the specific reaction described.
- **Score:** **1** (Barely plausible: Their roles are not as inhibitors, and their inclusion as inhibitors is awkward.)

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention DNA polymerase or ATP as inhibitors, nor is it logical for them to inhibit the reaction described. They are definitely wrong.
- **Score:** **3** (Definitely wrong: Not supported by the sentence.)

# **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|---------------|--------|
| 1: アクチノマイシンDおよびDNase | 2 | Common inhibitors, but ruled out by sentence | 3 | Explicitly stated as not inhibitors |
| 2: プロテアーゼおよびEDTA | 2 | Plausible lab inhibitors, not mentioned in sentence | 3 | Not supported by sentence |
| 3: DNAポリメラーゼおよびATP | 1 | Not typical inhibitors, awkward fit | 3 | Not supported by sentence |

# **Reasoning Summary**
- **Distractor 1** is moderately plausible because these are common inhibitors, but the sentence rules them out. It is definitely incorrect.
- **Distractor 2** is also moderately plausible as they are common lab reagents that could inhibit reactions, but not mentioned here. It is definitely incorrect.
- **Distractor 3** is barely plausible because their roles do not fit as inhibitors, making them awkward choices. It is definitely incorrect.

All distractors are **definitely incorrect** per the sentence, but their plausibility varies based on how commonly they are used as inhibitors in biomedical contexts.
