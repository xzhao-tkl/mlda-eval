sentence: 従って,膵胆管合流異常症の手術にあたっては肝外胆管の完全切除が重要である.
triple: {'subject': '膵胆管合流異常症の手術', 'relation': 'にあたって重要である', 'object': '肝外胆管の完全切除'}
question: 膵胆管合流異常症の手術において重要とされる処置は何ですか？
distractor 1: 膵頭部の部分切除
distractor 2: 胆嚢の摘出
distractor 3: 肝内胆管の部分切除

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 膵頭部の部分切除 (Partial resection of the pancreatic head)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** In the context of pancreaticobiliary surgery, resection of the pancreatic head is a known surgical procedure (e.g., Whipple procedure). However, for "膵胆管合流異常症" (pancreaticobiliary maljunction), the standard important procedure is complete excision of the extrahepatic bile duct, not pancreatic head resection. Still, the distractor is plausible as a surgical option in the domain, though not the standard for this condition.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence clearly states that "肝外胆管の完全切除" (complete excision of the extrahepatic bile duct) is important. Pancreatic head resection is not supported or mentioned as important in this context, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 胆嚢の摘出 (Cholecystectomy)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) is a very common procedure in biliary surgery and is often performed in conjunction with other procedures for biliary tract diseases. It is highly plausible as an answer, especially for those less familiar with the specific requirements of pancreaticobiliary maljunction surgery.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 2 (Likely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** While cholecystectomy may be performed, the sentence specifically highlights "肝外胆管の完全切除" as the important procedure. Cholecystectomy is not the main point emphasized, but it is not strictly contradictory, as it may be part of the overall surgical management. Thus, it is likely wrong, but not absolutely excluded.

---

## Distractor 3: 肝内胆管の部分切除 (Partial resection of intrahepatic bile duct)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Resection of intrahepatic bile ducts is a recognized surgical procedure, but it is not standard for pancreaticobiliary maljunction. It is plausible in the sense that it is a biliary tract surgery, but less likely to be considered important for this specific condition.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifies "肝外胆管の完全切除" (extrahepatic, not intrahepatic). Partial resection of intrahepatic bile ducts is not supported by the sentence and is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1. 膵頭部の部分切除 | 2 | Surgical option, but not standard for this disease | 3 | Not supported by sentence, definitely wrong |
| 2. 胆嚢の摘出 | 3 | Common biliary surgery, highly plausible | 2 | Not the main procedure, but not strictly excluded |
| 3. 肝内胆管の部分切除 | 2 | Biliary surgery, but not standard for this disease | 3 | Not supported by sentence, definitely wrong |

---

## Overall Reasoning

- All distractors are relevant to the domain and context of biliary/pancreatic surgery.
- Distractor 2 is the most plausible, as cholecystectomy is commonly performed and could confuse even experts.
- Distractors 1 and 3 are moderately plausible, as they are surgical procedures but not standard for this condition.
- All distractors are incorrect, with 1 and 3 being definitely wrong, and 2 being likely wrong (not the main procedure, but sometimes performed).
