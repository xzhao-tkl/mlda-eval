sentence: 骨盤骨折は大動脈遮断を行い一時止血した.
triple: {'subject': '骨盤骨折', 'relation': 'では', 'object': '大動脈遮断を行い一時止血する'}
question: 骨盤骨折の際に一時止血のために行われる処置は何ですか？
distractor 1: 骨盤外固定
distractor 2: 輸液療法
distractor 3: 止血帯の使用

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 骨盤外固定 (Pelvic external fixation)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Pelvic external fixation is a well-known emergency procedure for pelvic fractures to stabilize the pelvis and reduce bleeding. It is a plausible answer to "what procedure is performed for temporary hemostasis in pelvic fracture?" and fits the biomedical context well.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify "大動脈遮断" (aortic occlusion) as the procedure for temporary hemostasis. Pelvic external fixation is a different procedure, so it is clearly incorrect for this specific sentence.

---

## Distractor 2: 輸液療法 (Fluid therapy)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Fluid therapy is a general supportive measure in trauma and bleeding, but it is not a direct hemostatic procedure. It is somewhat plausible in the context of emergency management of pelvic fracture, but less specific than the correct answer.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence is about a procedure for temporary hemostasis, and fluid therapy does not directly stop bleeding. Therefore, it is definitely incorrect as an answer to the specific question.

---

## Distractor 3: 止血帯の使用 (Use of tourniquet)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Tourniquets are used for limb bleeding, not for pelvic fractures. While it is a hemostatic tool, its use in pelvic fracture is not standard or plausible for experts, but a layperson might consider it.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifies aortic occlusion for pelvic fracture. Tourniquet use is not appropriate or supported for this scenario, so it is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 骨盤外固定         | 3            | Standard emergency procedure for pelvic fracture, fits context well | 3             | Different from the specified procedure (aortic occlusion) |
| 輸液療法           | 2            | General trauma management, not a direct hemostatic procedure | 3             | Does not directly stop bleeding, not the answer in the sentence |
| 止血帯の使用       | 2            | Hemostatic tool, but not used for pelvic fracture | 3             | Not appropriate for pelvic fracture, not supported by the sentence |

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are clearly incorrect for the specific procedure described in the sentence.
- 骨盤外固定 is the most plausible distractor, as it is a standard emergency procedure for pelvic fracture.
- 輸液療法 and 止血帯の使用 are less plausible, as they are not direct or appropriate hemostatic procedures for pelvic fracture, but still make some sense in a trauma context.
