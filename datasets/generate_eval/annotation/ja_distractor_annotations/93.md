sentence: 経皮的膵組織生検は細胞診に優る診断能を有し, 安全で膵疾患の診断に有用である.
triple: {'subject': '経皮的膵組織生検', 'relation': 'は', 'object': '細胞診に優る診断能を有し、安全で膵疾患の診断に有用である'}
question: 膵疾患の診断において、細胞診よりも優れた診断能を持ち、安全性も高いとされる検査法は何ですか？
distractor 1: 腹部超音波検査
distractor 2: 膵液細胞診
distractor 3: CTガイド下穿刺吸引細胞診

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 腹部超音波検査 (Abdominal ultrasound)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Abdominal ultrasound is a common diagnostic tool for pancreatic diseases. It is safe and non-invasive, which matches part of the prompt ("安全"). However, it is not a tissue biopsy and does not have superior diagnostic ability compared to cytology for pancreatic disease. Still, it is plausible enough that a test-taker might consider it.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify "経皮的膵組織生検" (percutaneous pancreatic tissue biopsy) as superior to cytology. Abdominal ultrasound is not a biopsy and does not fit the description, so it is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 膵液細胞診 (Pancreatic juice cytology)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Pancreatic juice cytology is a direct cytological examination for pancreatic disease and is closely related to the correct answer. The prompt compares the correct answer to "細胞診", so this distractor is highly plausible and could easily confuse test-takers.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence explicitly states that the correct answer is superior to cytology (細胞診), so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: CTガイド下穿刺吸引細胞診 (CT-guided fine needle aspiration cytology)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** CT-guided FNA cytology is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure for pancreatic disease, and is often compared to tissue biopsy. It is safe and relevant in the context of pancreatic diagnostics, making it a highly plausible distractor.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence distinguishes tissue biopsy from cytology, stating that biopsy is superior. CT-guided FNA is a cytological method, not a tissue biopsy, so it is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 腹部超音波検査 | 2 | Common, safe, but not a biopsy or cytology | 3 | Not a biopsy, not superior to cytology |
| 膵液細胞診 | 3 | Directly related, easily confused with correct answer | 3 | Explicitly stated as inferior in sentence |
| CTガイド下穿刺吸引細胞診 | 3 | Highly relevant, similar procedure, plausible | 3 | Cytology, not tissue biopsy, thus incorrect |

## Overall Reasoning

- All distractors are clearly incorrect per the original sentence and triple.
- Distractors 2 and 3 are highly plausible and could confuse even experts, while distractor 1 is moderately plausible due to its general use in pancreatic diagnostics but lacks specificity.
- The set is well-constructed for a biomedical multiple-choice question.
