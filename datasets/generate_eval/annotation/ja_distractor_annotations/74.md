sentence: 転移性膵腫瘍において, 切除例に長期生存の報告もあり, 治療法の1選択肢として外科的切除も考慮すべきである.
triple: {'subject': '転移性膵腫瘍', 'relation': 'の治療法の1選択肢として考慮すべきなのは', 'object': '外科的切除'}
question: 転移性膵腫瘍の治療法として考慮すべき選択肢は何ですか？
distractor 1: 放射線治療
distractor 2: 化学療法のみ
distractor 3: 免疫療法

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 放射線治療 (Radiation Therapy)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Radiation therapy is a common treatment modality for many cancers, including metastatic tumors. In the context of "転移性膵腫瘍" (metastatic pancreatic tumor), radiation therapy is a plausible option that could be considered by clinicians, even if it's not the main focus of the original sentence. It fits the expected answer type (a treatment option) and is relevant in the biomedical domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specifically state that "外科的切除" (surgical resection) should be considered as a treatment option. There is no mention of radiation therapy being recommended or considered in this context, so this distractor is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 化学療法のみ (Chemotherapy only)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Chemotherapy is a standard treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer. The addition of "のみ" (only) makes it a bit more specific, but it remains a very plausible answer that could confuse even experts, as chemotherapy is often considered before surgical options in metastatic disease.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence emphasizes considering surgical resection as a treatment option, not chemotherapy alone. While chemotherapy may be used, the focus is on surgery, so this distractor is definitely incorrect in the context of the original sentence.

---

## Distractor 3: 免疫療法 (Immunotherapy)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Immunotherapy is an emerging treatment in oncology, but its role in metastatic pancreatic tumors is less established compared to chemotherapy or surgery. It is plausible as a distractor, but less convincing than the previous two, as it is not a standard or widely accepted option for this specific cancer type.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention immunotherapy as a treatment option. The focus is on surgical resection, so immunotherapy is definitely incorrect in this context.

## Summary Table

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 放射線治療         | 3            | Common cancer treatment, fits context well | 3             | Not mentioned, focus is on surgery |
| 化学療法のみ       | 3            | Standard for metastatic cancer, very plausible | 3             | Not the answer, focus is on surgery |
| 免疫療法           | 2            | Less standard for this cancer, plausible but weaker | 3             | Not mentioned, focus is on surgery |

## Overall Reasoning

All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence and triple, as the focus is on surgical resection. In terms of plausibility, 放射線治療 and 化学療法のみ are highly plausible distractors, while 免疫療法 is moderately plausible due to its less established role in this specific context. All distractors are relevant and fit the biomedical domain.
