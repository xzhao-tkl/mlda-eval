sentence: また,血液の止血機能を活用した接着剤に血液から抽出したフィブリン成分を活用したものがある。
triple: {'subject': '血液の止血機能を活用した接着剤', 'relation': 'には', 'object': '血液から抽出したフィブリン成分を活用したものがある'}
question: 血液から抽出したフィブリン成分を活用しているのはどのような接着剤ですか？
distractor 1: 生体組織の修復機能を活用した接着剤
distractor 2: 化学的合成成分を主成分とする接着剤
distractor 3: 細胞増殖因子を利用した接着剤

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 生体組織の修復機能を活用した接着剤  
("Adhesive utilizing the tissue repair function of living organisms")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
This distractor is somewhat plausible because "tissue repair function" is a biological concept and could be related to adhesives in the biomedical domain. However, it is not as specific as "blood clotting function" (止血機能) and does not directly relate to "fibrin extracted from blood." It could be ruled out by someone with basic biomedical knowledge, but it is not completely out of place.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
The original sentence clearly states that the adhesive in question utilizes the blood clotting function and specifically fibrin from blood. This distractor refers to a different biological function (tissue repair), which is not supported by the original sentence or triple.

## Distractor 2: 化学的合成成分を主成分とする接着剤  
("Adhesive mainly composed of chemically synthesized components")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
This is a very plausible distractor. Chemically synthesized adhesives are common in biomedical and general adhesive contexts. It fits the expected answer type and could easily confuse someone, as it is a valid category of adhesives but does not use blood-derived fibrin.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
The original sentence specifies the use of blood-derived fibrin, not synthetic chemicals. This distractor is clearly not supported by the sentence or triple.

---

## Distractor 3: 細胞増殖因子を利用した接着剤  
("Adhesive utilizing cell growth factors")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
This distractor is plausible in the biomedical context, as cell growth factors are sometimes used in tissue engineering and adhesives. However, it is not as directly related to the blood clotting function or fibrin as the correct answer. It could be ruled out by someone with basic knowledge of the specific function described.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
The original sentence and triple do not mention cell growth factors; they focus on fibrin from blood. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility (Score/Reason) | Incorrectness (Score/Reason) |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | 2: Moderately plausible; related but not specific to blood/fibrin | 3: Definitely wrong; refers to a different biological function |
| 2 | 3: Highly plausible; common adhesive type, fits context well | 3: Definitely wrong; not supported by sentence/triple |
| 3 | 2: Moderately plausible; biomedical relevance but not specific | 3: Definitely wrong; not mentioned in sentence/triple |

## Overall Reasoning
All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence and triple, but distractor 2 is the most plausible and could easily confuse even experts. Distractors 1 and 3 are moderately plausible, as they are relevant in the biomedical context but less directly related to the specific function described in the prompt. None of the distractors are implausible or grammatically incorrect.
