sentence: 塩基組成は下層土ほどマグネシウムの占める割合が高くなる。
triple: {'subject': '下層土の塩基組成', 'relation': 'では', 'object': 'マグネシウムの占める割合が高くなる'}
question: どのような土層ほど塩基組成におけるマグネシウムの占める割合が高くなりますか？
distractor 1: 表層土
distractor 2: 腐植土
distractor 3: 砂質土

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 表層土 (Surface soil)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "表層土" (surface soil) is a common soil layer and is a plausible candidate when asking about soil layers in the context of base composition. It fits the expected answer type and domain, and could easily confuse someone who is not paying close attention to the details of the sentence.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence states that "下層土ほどマグネシウムの占める割合が高くなる" (the deeper the soil layer, the higher the proportion of magnesium in the base composition). "表層土" is the opposite of "下層土" (subsoil), so it is definitely incorrect.

## Distractor 2: 腐植土 (Humus soil)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "腐植土" (humus soil) is a type of soil rich in organic matter, often found in the upper layers. It is relevant in the context of soil layers and base composition, but less directly plausible than "表層土" because the question is about the proportion of magnesium, which is typically higher in mineral subsoils rather than organic-rich topsoils. Still, it could be considered by someone with less domain knowledge.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence clearly states that magnesium proportion increases in deeper layers, not in humus-rich topsoil. Therefore, "腐植土" is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 砂質土 (Sandy soil)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "砂質土" (sandy soil) refers to soil texture rather than a specific layer. While it is a valid soil type and could be considered in the context of base composition, it is less plausible as an answer to a question specifically about soil layers. However, it is not completely out of place, as some might confuse soil type with soil layer.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence is about soil layers (depth), not soil texture. "砂質土" does not answer the question about which layer has a higher proportion of magnesium, so it is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor      | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 表層土          | 3            | Common soil layer, fits context and could confuse | 3             | Opposite of correct answer, definitely wrong |
| 腐植土          | 2            | Relevant, but less direct; plausible for non-experts | 3             | Not a deeper layer, definitely wrong |
| 砂質土          | 2            | Valid soil type, but less plausible for layer question | 3             | Not a layer, definitely wrong |

## Overall Reasoning

All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence, which specifies that deeper soil layers have a higher proportion of magnesium. "表層土" is the most plausible distractor, as it is a direct counterpart to "下層土" and fits the expected answer type. "腐植土" and "砂質土" are moderately plausible, as they are relevant soil terms but do not directly answer the question about soil layers. None of the distractors are ambiguous or partially correct, and none are implausible or irrelevant.
