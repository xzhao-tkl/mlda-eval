sentence: 一般にマトリックスタンパク質は細胞接着、伸展、細胞骨格の構築を促進する。
triple: {'subject': 'マトリックスタンパク質', 'relation': 'は促進する', 'object': '細胞接着、伸展、細胞骨格の構築'}
question: 細胞接着や伸展、細胞骨格の構築を促進するのは何ですか？
distractor 1: 細胞膜脂質
distractor 2: 細胞内酵素
distractor 3: 細胞外液成分

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 細胞膜脂質 (Cell membrane lipids)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Cell membrane lipids are a fundamental component of cells and are involved in various cellular processes. While they are not typically described as directly promoting cell adhesion, extension, or cytoskeletal construction, they are related to cell structure and function. A person with basic biomedical knowledge could see this as a plausible, though not perfect, answer.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence clearly states that "マトリックスタンパク質" (matrix proteins) promote these processes, not membrane lipids. There is no support in the sentence for cell membrane lipids being the correct answer.

---

## Distractor 2: 細胞内酵素 (Intracellular enzymes)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Intracellular enzymes are involved in many cellular activities, including signaling and metabolism, which can indirectly affect cell adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics. However, they are not the direct agents described in the sentence, but the connection is not far-fetched.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention intracellular enzymes as promoting these processes. The correct answer is matrix proteins, so this distractor is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 細胞外液成分 (Extracellular fluid components)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Extracellular fluid components are present outside cells and could theoretically influence cell behavior. However, they are not typically described as directly promoting cell adhesion, extension, or cytoskeletal construction. Still, the distractor is not completely out of place in a biomedical context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence attributes the promotion of these processes to matrix proteins, not extracellular fluid components. There is no ambiguity here.

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 細胞膜脂質         | 2            | Related to cell structure, not direct agent | 3             | Not supported by sentence |
| 細胞内酵素         | 2            | Involved in cell processes, not direct agent | 3             | Not supported by sentence |
| 細胞外液成分       | 2            | Present in context, not direct agent         | 3             | Not supported by sentence |

## Overall Reasoning

All distractors are moderately plausible in a biomedical context—they are related to cell structure or environment, but none are the direct answer given by the sentence. All are definitely incorrect, as the sentence clearly identifies matrix proteins as the agents promoting cell adhesion, extension, and cytoskeletal construction. The distractors are well-chosen for plausibility and clear incorrectness.
