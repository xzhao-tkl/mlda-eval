sentence: 多発性肝転移に対して,マイクロ波凝固療法と肝動注化学療法を組み合わせた集学的治療は有効な治療法の1つであると考えられた.
triple: {'subject': '多発性肝転移', 'relation': 'に対して有効な治療法の1つである', 'object': 'マイクロ波凝固療法と肝動注化学療法を組み合わせた集学的治療'}
question: 多発性肝転移に対して有効な治療法の一つと考えられている治療法は何ですか？
distractor 1: 肝切除術のみを行う治療
distractor 2: 放射線療法単独による治療
distractor 3: 経口抗がん剤のみを用いた治療

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 肝切除術のみを行う治療 (Treatment by liver resection alone)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Liver resection is a standard treatment for liver tumors, including metastases, in certain cases. It is a plausible answer for "effective treatment for multiple liver metastases" in a biomedical context, even though the original sentence emphasizes a combination therapy.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically states that the effective treatment is a combination of microwave coagulation therapy and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, not liver resection alone. Thus, this distractor is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 放射線療法単独による治療 (Treatment by radiation therapy alone)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Radiation therapy is sometimes used for liver metastases, but it is less commonly considered a primary or highly effective treatment compared to surgical or interventional therapies. It is plausible but less convincing than surgical or combination therapies.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention radiation therapy as the effective treatment; it specifies a combination of microwave coagulation and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy. Radiation therapy alone is not supported by the sentence.

---

## Distractor 3: 経口抗がん剤のみを用いた治療 (Treatment using only oral anticancer drugs)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Oral anticancer drugs are used for metastatic cancers, but for multiple liver metastases, local or combination therapies are generally preferred for effectiveness. This option is plausible but less so than interventional or surgical approaches.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention oral anticancer drugs as the effective treatment; it specifies a combination of local therapies. Thus, this distractor is clearly incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 肝切除術のみ | 3 | Standard treatment, fits context | 3 | Not the combination therapy specified |
| 放射線療法単独 | 2 | Used but less common for this indication | 3 | Not mentioned, not the specified therapy |
| 経口抗がん剤のみ | 2 | Used but less effective for this case | 3 | Not mentioned, not the specified therapy |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence, which specifies a combination therapy. In terms of plausibility, liver resection is the most convincing distractor, while radiation therapy and oral drugs are plausible but less so for this specific context. All distractors are relevant and domain-appropriate.
