sentence: 特に牛血液は, 血中の因子が性能に与える影響を調べるのに使用されているが, 牛血液と人血液の物性には違いがあり, 牛血液を用いた場合の性能が人血液の場合に必ずしも適用できない。
triple: {'subject': '牛血液と人血液', 'relation': 'の物性には違いがある', 'object': '物性'}
question: 牛血液と人血液で異なる性質として挙げられているのは何ですか？
distractor 1: 抗体の種類
distractor 2: 血球数
distractor 3: 酵素活性

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 抗体の種類 (Type of antibody)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "抗体の種類" is a plausible property that could differ between cow and human blood, especially in biomedical contexts. It fits the domain and could be considered a "property" (物性) in a broad sense, though it's more immunological than physical/chemical. It is not as directly related to "物性" (which usually refers to physical/chemical properties), but it is not out of place.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify that the difference is in "物性" (physical properties), not specifically in antibody types. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect as the answer to the prompt.

## Distractor 2: 血球数 (Number of blood cells)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "血球数" is a very plausible property that could differ between cow and human blood and is often considered a physical property in biomedical contexts. It fits the subject, relation, and expected answer type very well.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 2 (Likely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not specify "血球数" as the property that differs; they only mention "物性" in general. While "血球数" could be a component of "物性," the prompt does not specify it, so it is likely wrong but not absolutely contradicted.

---

## Distractor 3: 酵素活性 (Enzyme activity)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "酵素活性" is a plausible property that could differ between cow and human blood, and is relevant in biomedical contexts. However, it is more of a biochemical property than a physical one, so it is somewhat less directly related to "物性" as typically defined.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention "酵素活性" as the differing property; they only mention "物性." Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect as the answer.

## Summary Table

| Distractor         | Plausibility (Score, Reason) | Incorrectness (Score, Reason) |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 抗体の種類         | 2: plausible, fits domain but not directly "物性" | 3: definitely not the answer given the sentence |
| 血球数             | 3: highly plausible, fits "物性" well | 2: likely wrong, not specified but possible sub-property |
| 酵素活性           | 2: plausible, relevant but less direct | 3: definitely not the answer given the sentence |

## Reasoning Summary

- All distractors are plausible in the biomedical context, with "血球数" being the most convincing as a physical property.
- None of the distractors are the correct answer ("物性"), and all are clearly incorrect given the original sentence and triple, though "血球数" is a bit ambiguous as it could be considered a sub-property of "物性."
- The distractors are well-chosen for plausibility and incorrectness, with a slight caveat for "血球数" being a borderline case for incorrectness.
