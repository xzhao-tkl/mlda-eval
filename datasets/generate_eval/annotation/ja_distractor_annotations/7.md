sentence: 2)明視時間は視標の縮小に伴い増加を示し,視標1.0(視角1分)では1,000~1,500 msecを必要とし,日常視における調節時間および調節微動に対応すると推察される。
triple: {'subject': '明視時間', 'relation': 'は視標の縮小に伴い増加し', 'object': '視標1.0（視角1分）では1,000〜1,500 msecを必要とし、日常視における調節時間および調節微動に対応すると推察される'}
question: 視標1.0（視角1分）の場合、明視時間として必要とされる時間はどれくらいですか？
distractor 1: 100〜300 msec
distractor 2: 2,000〜2,500 msec
distractor 3: 500〜800 msec

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 100〜300 msec

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The distractor is a plausible time interval for a biomedical measurement, and the units (msec) are correct. However, it is much lower than the correct range (1,000–1,500 msec) given in the sentence. While it could be considered by someone unfamiliar with the specific context, basic domain knowledge (knowing that "明視時間" for small visual angles is longer) would rule it out.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The original sentence clearly states that 1,000–1,500 msec is required for 視標1.0（視角1分）. 100–300 msec is not supported and is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 2,000〜2,500 msec

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  This distractor is very close to the correct answer and within a reasonable range for the context. It could easily confuse even experts, as it is a plausible value for "明視時間" and fits the domain and context well.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The sentence specifies 1,000–1,500 msec, so 2,000–2,500 msec is not supported and is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 500〜800 msec

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  This is a plausible distractor in terms of units and context, but it is lower than the correct range. Someone with basic domain knowledge would likely rule it out, but it is not immediately nonsensical.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The sentence clearly states the required time is 1,000–1,500 msec, so 500–800 msec is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 100〜300 msec      | 2            | Plausible, but too low; basic knowledge rules out | 3             | Clearly not supported by sentence |
| 2,000〜2,500 msec  | 3            | Very plausible, close to correct, could confuse experts | 3             | Clearly not supported by sentence |
| 500〜800 msec      | 2            | Plausible, but too low; basic knowledge rules out | 3             | Clearly not supported by sentence |

## Overall Reasoning

- All distractors are **incorrect** according to the original sentence.
- Distractor 2 is the most plausible and could easily confuse even experts.
- Distractors 1 and 3 are plausible but less so, as they are much lower than the correct range and can be ruled out with basic domain knowledge.  
- None of the distractors are implausible or nonsensical.  
- All distractors are relevant and fit the expected answer type (time in msec).
