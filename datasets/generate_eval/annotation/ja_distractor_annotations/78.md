sentence: AVMに対しては塞栓術を併用した全切除術を目標とするが,症状,病態,患者背景を考慮した治療戦略を立てることが肝要である.
triple: {'subject': 'AVMの治療', 'relation': 'の目標は', 'object': '塞栓術を併用した全切除術'}
question: AVMの治療において目標とされる治療法は何ですか？
distractor 1: 放射線治療のみ
distractor 2: 薬物療法による保存的治療
distractor 3: 部分切除術のみ

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 放射線治療のみ (Radiation therapy only)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Radiation therapy is a recognized treatment modality for AVM (arteriovenous malformation) in the biomedical field. While "only" radiation therapy is not the standard goal for AVM treatment (especially when the sentence emphasizes "塞栓術を併用した全切除術" - complete resection with embolization), it is plausible as a treatment option. However, experts would know that it is not the main goal, but it is not nonsensical.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence clearly states that the goal is "塞栓術を併用した全切除術" (complete resection with embolization), not radiation therapy alone. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Distractor 2: 薬物療法による保存的治療 (Conservative treatment with drug therapy)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Conservative drug therapy is sometimes considered for AVM patients who are not candidates for surgery, but it is not a curative or goal-directed treatment for AVM. It is plausible as a treatment approach, but not as the main goal, especially in the context of the sentence.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence specifies that the goal is "complete resection with embolization," not conservative drug therapy. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 部分切除術のみ (Partial resection only)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Partial resection is a surgical approach and could be considered as a treatment for AVM, especially in cases where complete resection is not possible. It is very plausible and could confuse even experts, as it is close to the correct answer but lacks the "complete" aspect and the embolization.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence clearly states that the goal is "complete resection with embolization," not partial resection only. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 放射線治療のみ | 2 | Recognized treatment, but not the main goal | 3 | Clearly not the goal stated in the sentence |
| 薬物療法による保存的治療 | 2 | Sometimes used, but not curative or goal-directed | 3 | Not the goal per the sentence |
| 部分切除術のみ | 3 | Very plausible, close to correct answer | 3 | Not the goal, lacks "complete" and "embolization" |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are clearly incorrect per the original sentence and triple. In terms of plausibility, "部分切除術のみ" is the most convincing, as it is a surgical approach and could be mistaken for the goal. The other two are plausible but less so, as they are not typically considered curative or goal-directed for AVM. None of the distractors are implausible or irrelevant.
