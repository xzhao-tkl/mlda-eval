sentence: この培養直後の不活性胞子の割合の増加は,温度(15∼30°C)と土壌水分(含量35∼100%)にほとんど影響されなかったが,土壌pHには大きく影響され,pHが約4.5∼6.5の酸性土壌で増加が大きかった。
triple: {'subject': '培養直後の不活性胞子の割合の増加', 'relation': 'は影響される', 'object': '土壌pH（特にpH約4.5〜6.5の酸性土壌）'}
question: 培養直後の不活性胞子の割合の増加に大きく影響する要因は何ですか？
distractor 1: 温度（15〜30°C）
distractor 2: 土壌水分（含量35〜100%）
distractor 3: 光照射強度

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

### Distractor 1: 温度（15〜30°C）

#### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Temperature is a common environmental factor affecting biological processes, especially in microbiology and soil science. The prompt mentions temperature as a variable, making it a very plausible candidate for influencing the increase in inactive spores.

#### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence explicitly states that the increase in inactive spores was "ほとんど影響されなかった" (hardly affected) by temperature. Therefore, temperature is definitely not the correct answer.

---

### Distractor 2: 土壌水分（含量35〜100%）

#### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Soil moisture is another standard factor in soil biology and is directly mentioned in the sentence as a variable. It is a convincing distractor for the context.

#### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence states that the increase in inactive spores was "ほとんど影響されなかった" (hardly affected) by soil moisture. Thus, it is definitely incorrect as the answer.

---

### Distractor 3: 光照射強度

#### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Light intensity is a plausible environmental factor in some biological contexts, but in soil microbiology, especially regarding spores and pH, it is less commonly considered. It is not mentioned in the sentence, but it is not entirely out of place.

#### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention light intensity as a factor, and there is no evidence that it affects the increase in inactive spores in this context. Therefore, it is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 温度（15〜30°C） | 3 | Directly mentioned, plausible factor | 3 | Explicitly stated as not affecting |
| 土壌水分（含量35〜100%） | 3 | Directly mentioned, plausible factor | 3 | Explicitly stated as not affecting |
| 光照射強度 | 2 | Plausible but less relevant, not mentioned | 3 | Not mentioned, no evidence of effect |

## Overall Reasoning

- Distractors 1 and 2 are excellent: they are highly plausible and clearly incorrect based on the sentence.
- Distractor 3 is moderately plausible (less relevant in this context) but still clearly incorrect.
- All distractors are relevant to the domain and context, and none are ambiguous or accidentally correct.
