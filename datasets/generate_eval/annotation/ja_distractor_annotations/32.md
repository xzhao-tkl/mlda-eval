sentence: DNA損傷により引き起こされるリン酸化、ユビキチン化などのヒストンH2AXの修飾はDNA修復において非常に重要である。
triple: {'subject': 'DNA損傷により引き起こされるヒストンH2AXの修飾（リン酸化、ユビキチン化）', 'relation': 'は', 'object': 'DNA修復において非常に重要である'}
question: DNA修復において非常に重要とされる、DNA損傷によって引き起こされるヒストンH2AXの修飾にはどのようなものがありますか？
distractor 1: メチル化、アセチル化などのヒストンH3の修飾
distractor 2: リン酸化、ユビキチン化などのヒストンH1の修飾
distractor 3: アセチル化、SUMO化などのヒストンH2Bの修飾

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1: メチル化、アセチル化などのヒストンH3の修飾

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - "メチル化" and "アセチル化" are common histone modifications and relevant in the context of chromatin biology.
  - "ヒストンH3" is a real histone, and its modifications are important in gene regulation, but the question specifically asks about H2AX modifications in the context of DNA damage and repair.
  - An expert would know H3 is not the main histone involved in DNA damage response, but a non-expert might find it plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The original sentence and triple clearly state that H2AX modifications (phosphorylation, ubiquitination) are important for DNA repair, not H3 modifications.
  - This distractor is not supported by the original sentence and is definitely incorrect.

## Distractor 2: リン酸化、ユビキチン化などのヒストンH1の修飾

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - "リン酸化" and "ユビキチン化" are the correct types of modifications, but the histone is H1, not H2AX.
  - H1 is a real histone, and its modifications do occur, but it is not the canonical histone involved in DNA damage response.
  - The distractor is plausible to someone who knows about histone modifications but not the specific role of H2AX.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The original sentence is about H2AX, not H1. The distractor is not supported by the original sentence and is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: アセチル化、SUMO化などのヒストンH2Bの修飾

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - "アセチル化" and "SUMO化" are plausible histone modifications, and H2B is a real histone.
  - However, the question is specifically about H2AX modifications in DNA repair, and H2B is not the main histone involved in this process.
  - The distractor is plausible in the general context of histone modification but not specific to the DNA damage response.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  - The original sentence and triple are about H2AX modifications, not H2B. This distractor is not supported by the original sentence and is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1 (H3)     | 2            | Common modifications, plausible but not specific to H2AX/DNA repair | 3 | Clearly not supported by the sentence/triple |
| 2 (H1)     | 2            | Correct modification types, but wrong histone | 3 | Clearly not supported by the sentence/triple |
| 3 (H2B)    | 2            | Plausible modifications, but wrong histone for DNA repair | 3 | Clearly not supported by the sentence/triple |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are moderately plausible because they mention real histones and modifications relevant to chromatin biology, but they are not the specific modifications of H2AX involved in DNA repair. All are definitely incorrect according to the original sentence and triple, as none refer to H2AX. This makes them good distractors for a biomedical multiple-choice question.
