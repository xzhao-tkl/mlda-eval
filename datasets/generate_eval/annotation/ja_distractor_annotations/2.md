sentence: 破裂性腹部大動脈瘤(rAAA)に対する腹部大動脈ステントグラフト内挿術(EVAR)術後の重要な合併症の1つに腹部コンパートメント症候群(ACS)がある.
triple: {'subject': '破裂性腹部大動脈瘤(rAAA)に対する腹部大動脈ステントグラフト内挿術(EVAR)術後', 'relation': 'の重要な合併症の1つは', 'object': '腹部コンパートメント症候群（ACS）'}
question: 破裂性腹部大動脈瘤(rAAA)に対するEVAR術後に重要な合併症として挙げられる疾患は何ですか？
distractor 1: 急性腎不全
distractor 2: 肺塞栓症
distractor 3: 消化管出血

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 急性腎不全 (Acute Renal Failure)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Acute renal failure is a well-known complication after major vascular surgery, including EVAR for ruptured AAA. It is a plausible answer that could confuse even experts, as renal dysfunction is a common concern postoperatively in this context.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically identifies "腹部コンパートメント症候群（ACS）" as the important complication. While acute renal failure is possible, it is not the one named in the sentence/triple, so it is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 肺塞栓症 (Pulmonary Embolism)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Pulmonary embolism is a possible postoperative complication in many surgeries, including vascular procedures. However, it is less directly associated with EVAR for ruptured AAA compared to ACS or renal failure. It fits the domain but is less likely than the first distractor.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention pulmonary embolism as a major complication. It is not supported by the original sentence/triple, so it is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 消化管出血 (Gastrointestinal Bleeding)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur after major abdominal surgery, but it is not a classic or common complication of EVAR for ruptured AAA. It is plausible in a broad sense but less convincing than renal failure.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention GI bleeding as a major complication. It is not the correct answer per the sentence/triple.

## Summary Table

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 急性腎不全         | 3            | Common, convincing post-EVAR complication | 3             | Not the answer in the sentence/triple |
| 肺塞栓症           | 2            | Possible, but less directly related      | 3             | Not mentioned in the sentence/triple  |
| 消化管出血         | 2            | Possible, but not classic for EVAR       | 3             | Not mentioned in the sentence/triple  |

## Overall Reasoning

- All distractors are **incorrect** per the original sentence/triple, so they score 3 for incorrectness.
- **Acute renal failure** is the most plausible distractor, as it is a well-known and feared complication after EVAR for ruptured AAA.
- **Pulmonary embolism** and **gastrointestinal bleeding** are plausible in a general surgical context, but less directly associated with EVAR for rAAA, so they score 2 for plausibility.

**All distractors are valid, with distractor 1 being the strongest in terms of plausibility.**
