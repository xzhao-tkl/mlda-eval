sentence: 施用した窒素のうち地下へ溶脱した割合は,標準栽培が19.6%,多肥栽培が39.6%であり,多肥栽培は地下水の硝酸態窒素濃度の上昇に影響を与える可能性があることを示した.
triple: {'subject': '多肥栽培', 'relation': 'は', 'object': '地下水の硝酸態窒素濃度の上昇に影響を与える可能性がある'}
question: 多肥栽培が影響を与える可能性があるのは何の上昇ですか？
distractor 1: 地下水のリン濃度の上昇
distractor 2: 土壌中のカリウム濃度の上昇
distractor 3: 大気中の二酸化炭素濃度の上昇

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 地下水のリン濃度の上昇 (Increase in groundwater phosphorus concentration)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Phosphorus is a common nutrient in agricultural contexts, and its leaching into groundwater is a known environmental concern, similar to nitrate. The distractor fits the subject (多肥栽培, heavy fertilization), the relation (影響を与える可能性), and the expected answer type (a chemical concentration in groundwater). It is a convincing alternative that could plausibly confuse even experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specifically mention nitrate (硝酸態窒素) and not phosphorus (リン). There is no support for phosphorus in the context, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 土壌中のカリウム濃度の上昇 (Increase in soil potassium concentration)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Potassium is another common fertilizer component, but the context is about groundwater contamination, not soil nutrient levels. While it is related to agriculture, the shift from groundwater to soil makes it less plausible, though still reasonable for someone with less domain knowledge.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence is about groundwater nitrate, not soil potassium. There is no mention of potassium or soil concentration, so this is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 大気中の二酸化炭素濃度の上昇 (Increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** While agriculture can affect CO₂ levels, the context is about groundwater and fertilizer leaching, not atmospheric gases. This distractor is easily ruled out by anyone familiar with the topic, as it is not a direct consequence of fertilizer leaching.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple are about groundwater nitrate, not atmospheric CO₂. There is no support for this in the context, so it is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 (リン)   | 3            | Fits domain, plausible confusion | 3            | Not supported by sentence/triple |
| 2 (カリウム)| 2            | Related to agriculture, but not groundwater | 3            | Not supported by sentence/triple |
| 3 (CO₂)    | 1            | Not relevant to groundwater/fertilizer context | 3            | Not supported by sentence/triple |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
- Distractor 1 is the strongest, as it is both plausible and clearly incorrect.
- Distractor 2 is moderately plausible but still clearly incorrect.
- Distractor 3 is barely plausible and clearly incorrect.

All distractors are incorrect, but their plausibility varies based on how closely they relate to the context of groundwater contamination by fertilizer use.
