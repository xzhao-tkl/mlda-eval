sentence: また葉身の20%に相当する面積に薬斑を起こさせれば落葉が誘起される。
triple: {'subject': '葉身の20%に相当する面積に薬斑が生じた場合', 'relation': 'では', 'object': '落葉が誘起される'}
question: 落葉が誘起されるのは、葉身のどの程度の面積に薬斑が生じた場合ですか？
distractor 1: 葉身の5%に相当する面積
distractor 2: 葉身の50%に相当する面積
distractor 3: 葉身の80%に相当する面積

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 葉身の5%に相当する面積

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** 5% is a reasonable, believable percentage for a biomedical context (e.g., leaf damage). It fits the expected answer type (percentage of leaf area). However, it's much lower than the original (20%), so a domain expert might suspect it's too little to induce leaf fall, but it's not obviously implausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence clearly states that 20% is the threshold for leaf fall induction. 5% is not supported by the sentence and is definitely incorrect.

## Distractor 2: 葉身の50%に相当する面積

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** 50% is a plausible and convincing distractor. It's a common threshold in biological studies and could easily confuse someone, as it is a reasonable value for significant leaf damage. It fits the context and domain perfectly.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence specifies 20%, not 50%. While 50% might also induce leaf fall, the question asks for the threshold given in the sentence, so this is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 葉身の80%に相当する面積

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** 80% is also a plausible distractor. It is a high value, but still reasonable in the context of leaf damage and biomedical studies. It fits the expected answer type and could confuse test-takers.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence states 20%, not 80%. 80% is not supported by the original sentence and is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 5%         | 2            | Reasonable, but low; fits context | 3            | Clearly not the threshold in the sentence |
| 50%        | 3            | Very plausible, common threshold | 3            | Not supported by the sentence |
| 80%        | 3            | Very plausible, fits context | 3            | Not supported by the sentence |

## Overall Reasoning

All distractors are relevant and plausible in the biomedical context, with 50% and 80% being especially convincing. All are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence, which specifies 20% as the threshold for leaf fall induction. The distractors are well-designed for a multiple-choice setting.
