sentence: 単純胆摘術30例, 準標準的又は標準的胆嚢癌根治術が19例, その他の手術が2例になされた, 早期癌の予後は術式によらず良好であったが, ss癌は術式により有意差を認めた (5生率: 単純胆摘術31%, 準標準的手術又は標準的手術88%).術中診断は有用であったが, 予後向上のためには進展度に応じた術式が施行されなければならない.
triple: {'subject': 'ss癌（進展した胆嚢癌）', 'relation': 'の予後を改善するためには', 'object': '進展度に応じた術式の施行が必要である'}
question: 進展した胆嚢癌（ss癌）の予後向上のために必要とされる治療方針は何ですか？
distractor 1: 単純胆摘術の施行
distractor 2: 化学療法の単独施行
distractor 3: 放射線治療の施行

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 単純胆摘術の施行 (Simple cholecystectomy)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Simple cholecystectomy is a real surgical option for gallbladder cancer and is mentioned in the sentence as one of the procedures performed. It is a plausible answer to the question about treatment options for advanced gallbladder cancer, especially since the prompt discusses different surgical approaches.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that for advanced gallbladder cancer (ss癌), simple cholecystectomy is *not* sufficient for improving prognosis; more advanced surgery tailored to the extent of disease is required. The 5-year survival rate for simple cholecystectomy is much lower (31%) compared to more extensive surgery (88%), so this option is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 化学療法の単独施行 (Chemotherapy alone)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Chemotherapy is a recognized treatment modality for many cancers, including gallbladder cancer. However, the sentence and triple focus on surgical approaches, and chemotherapy is not mentioned as a primary or effective option for improving prognosis in this context. Still, it is plausible as a distractor because it is a common cancer treatment.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not support chemotherapy alone as the necessary treatment for improving prognosis in advanced gallbladder cancer. The focus is on surgery tailored to the extent of disease, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 放射線治療の施行 (Radiation therapy)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Radiation therapy is another standard cancer treatment, but it is not mentioned in the sentence or triple as a relevant option for improving prognosis in advanced gallbladder cancer. It is plausible in the general cancer context, but less so in this specific surgical context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not support radiation therapy as the necessary treatment for improving prognosis in advanced gallbladder cancer. The required approach is surgery tailored to the extent of disease, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1. 単純胆摘術の施行 | 3 | Real surgical option, discussed in context | 3 | Clearly not sufficient per sentence/triple |
| 2. 化学療法の単独施行 | 2 | Common cancer treatment, but not discussed here | 3 | Not supported by sentence/triple |
| 3. 放射線治療の施行 | 2 | Common cancer treatment, but not discussed here | 3 | Not supported by sentence/triple |

## Overall Reasoning

All distractors are clearly incorrect per the original sentence and triple, as the required treatment is "surgery tailored to the extent of disease." The first distractor is highly plausible because it is a real surgical option and is discussed in the context, while the other two are moderately plausible as they are standard cancer treatments but not specifically relevant to the context of surgical management for advanced gallbladder cancer.
