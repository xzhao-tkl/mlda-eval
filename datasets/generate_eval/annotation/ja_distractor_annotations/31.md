sentence: しかし,広範囲の頭蓋骨露出創では,外板をすべて除去することで術中出血量が増加し,頭蓋骨の強度が低下する恐れがある。
triple: {'subject': '広範囲の頭蓋骨露出創において外板をすべて除去すること', 'relation': 'によって生じる可能性がある', 'object': '術中出血量の増加と頭蓋骨の強度の低下'}
question: 広範囲の頭蓋骨露出創で術中出血量の増加や頭蓋骨の強度低下の恐れがあるのは、どのような処置を行った場合ですか？
distractor 1: 外板を部分的に温存すること
distractor 2: 頭蓋骨を全く処置しないこと
distractor 3: 頭蓋骨の内板のみを除去すること

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1: 外板を部分的に温存すること  
("Partially preserving the outer table")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  This option is plausible because it refers to a surgical approach related to the outer table of the skull, which is the focus of the original sentence. However, "partially preserving" is the opposite of "removing all," and would likely *reduce* the risk of increased bleeding and decreased bone strength, not cause it. Still, it is a reasonable distractor because it is a common alternative surgical strategy and fits the context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The original sentence states that *removing all* of the outer table increases bleeding and decreases strength. *Partially preserving* the outer table would not cause these risks to the same extent, so this distractor is definitely incorrect as an answer to the question.

## Distractor 2: 頭蓋骨を全く処置しないこと  
("Not treating the skull at all")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  This option is plausible in the sense that it is a possible surgical choice (doing nothing to the skull). However, it is less likely to be associated with increased intraoperative bleeding or decreased bone strength, since no intervention is performed. It fits the context but is not as strong a distractor as one that involves some manipulation of the skull.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The original sentence links the risks to *removal* of the outer table, not to doing nothing. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 頭蓋骨の内板のみを除去すること  
("Removing only the inner table of the skull")

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  This is a very plausible distractor. It involves a surgical procedure on the skull, specifically removing the inner table rather than the outer table. This could conceivably be associated with risks, and the distinction between inner and outer table may confuse even experts, making it a strong distractor.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:**  
  The original sentence specifically refers to *removal of the outer table* as causing the risks. Removing only the inner table is a different procedure and is not supported by the sentence as causing the same risks. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1. 外板を部分的に温存すること | 2 | Related procedure, but opposite effect | 3 | Not supported by sentence |
| 2. 頭蓋骨を全く処置しないこと | 2 | Possible choice, but unlikely to cause risks | 3 | Not supported by sentence |
| 3. 頭蓋骨の内板のみを除去すること | 3 | Very plausible, similar procedure, could confuse experts | 3 | Not supported by sentence |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are **incorrect** as answers to the question, as none match the described risk-causing procedure.
- Distractor 3 is the most plausible and effective, as it closely resembles the correct answer and could confuse even experts.
- Distractors 1 and 2 are moderately plausible, as they are reasonable alternatives but less likely to be mistaken for the correct answer.
