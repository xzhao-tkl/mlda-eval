sentence: 腫瘍内毛細血管のうち, 細い血管 (5~12μm) は主に線維部に, 太い洞様血管 (40~50μm) は主に腺組織周囲に分布していた。
triple: {'subject': '細い血管 (5~12μm)', 'relation': 'は主に分布している', 'object': '腫瘍内の線維部'}
question: 腫瘍内の線維部に主に分布している血管のタイプは何ですか？
distractor 1: 太い洞様血管 (40~50μm)
distractor 2: 中間径血管 (20~30μm)
distractor 3: リンパ管

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1: 太い洞様血管 (40~50μm)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence directly contrasts "細い血管 (5~12μm)" with "太い洞様血管 (40~50μm)", both being types of blood vessels found in tumors. The question asks about the type of vessel distributed mainly in the fibrous part of the tumor. "太い洞様血管" is a plausible distractor because it is a real vessel type mentioned in the context and could easily be confused with the correct answer.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence clearly states that "太い洞様血管 (40~50μm)" are mainly distributed around glandular tissue, not the fibrous part. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect for the specific question.

---

## Distractor 2: 中間径血管 (20~30μm)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "中間径血管 (20~30μm)" is not mentioned in the original sentence, but it is a plausible type of blood vessel in biomedical contexts. It fits the expected answer type and could be considered by someone who doesn't recall the exact details.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence only mentions "細い血管" and "太い洞様血管" with specific distributions. There is no mention of "中間径血管" being distributed in the fibrous part, so it is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: リンパ管

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "リンパ管" (lymphatic vessel) is a type of vessel found in tissues and tumors, so it is plausible in a biomedical context. However, the sentence is specifically about blood vessels, not lymphatic vessels, so it is less plausible than the other options.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence is about blood vessels ("血管"), not lymphatic vessels ("リンパ管"). Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect for the question.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|---------------|--------|
| 太い洞様血管 (40~50μm) | 3 | Directly mentioned, plausible confusion | 3 | Clearly not the correct location |
| 中間径血管 (20~30μm) | 2 | Plausible type, not mentioned | 3 | Not supported by sentence |
| リンパ管 | 2 | Plausible vessel, but not blood vessel | 3 | Not a blood vessel, so definitely wrong |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
- All distractors are clearly incorrect for the specific question, scoring 3 for Incorrectness.
- Plausibility is highest for distractor 1, which is directly mentioned and could easily confuse test-takers. Distractors 2 and 3 are plausible in a biomedical context but less so than distractor 1, as they are either not mentioned or not the correct vessel type.
