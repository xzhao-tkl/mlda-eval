sentence: TAZ/PIPCの抗菌力は培地の種類, 培地pH, ウマ血清添加, 接種菌量の影響はほとんど受けなかった。
triple: {'subject': 'TAZ/PIPCの抗菌力', 'relation': 'はほとんど影響を受けない', 'object': '培地の種類、培地pH、ウマ血清添加、接種菌量'}
question: TAZ/PIPCの抗菌力がほとんど影響を受けない要因として挙げられているものは何ですか？
distractor 1: 温度変化、抗生物質濃度、培養時間、酸素濃度
distractor 2: 菌種の違い、培地の糖分、培地の塩分、培地のビタミン含有量
distractor 3: 保存方法、凍結回数、光照射、培地の水分量

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 温度変化、抗生物質濃度、培養時間、酸素濃度  
### 1) Plausibility in Context  
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
All listed factors (temperature change, antibiotic concentration, culture time, oxygen concentration) are common variables that can affect antimicrobial activity in biomedical experiments. They are plausible candidates for factors that might influence TAZ/PIPC's antimicrobial power, fitting the expected answer type and domain.

### 2) Incorrectness  
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
The original sentence explicitly states that TAZ/PIPC's antimicrobial activity is *not* affected by "培地の種類, 培地pH, ウマ血清添加, 接種菌量" (medium type, medium pH, horse serum addition, inoculum size). Distractor 1 lists entirely different factors, which are not mentioned as unaffected in the sentence. Thus, these are definitely incorrect as the answer.

---

## Distractor 2: 菌種の違い、培地の糖分、培地の塩分、培地のビタミン含有量  
### 1) Plausibility in Context  
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
These factors (strain differences, medium sugar, medium salt, medium vitamin content) are relevant in microbiology and could plausibly affect antimicrobial activity. However, "菌種の違い" (strain differences) is a bit less likely to be grouped with the others as a medium property, and the rest are more specific subtypes of medium composition, which is already covered in the original answer. Still, they are plausible but slightly less convincing than Distractor 1.

### 2) Incorrectness  
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
None of these factors are listed in the original sentence as those that TAZ/PIPC's antimicrobial activity is unaffected by. Therefore, they are definitely incorrect as the answer.

---

## Distractor 3: 保存方法、凍結回数、光照射、培地の水分量  
### 1) Plausibility in Context  
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
These factors (storage method, number of freeze-thaw cycles, light exposure, medium moisture content) are less commonly considered direct influences on antimicrobial activity in standard testing, but they are still relevant in laboratory settings. "保存方法" and "凍結回数" are more about sample handling than experimental conditions, making them less plausible than Distractor 1, but not completely implausible.

### 2) Incorrectness  
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
These are not mentioned in the original sentence as factors that TAZ/PIPC's antimicrobial activity is unaffected by, so they are definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reasoning | Incorrectness | Reasoning |
|------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | 3 | All are plausible experimental factors in the domain. | 3 | Not listed in the original sentence; definitely wrong. |
| 2 | 2 | Relevant, but some are subtypes or less likely as a group. | 3 | Not listed; definitely wrong. |
| 3 | 2 | Less direct, but still plausible in lab context. | 3 | Not listed; definitely wrong. |

---

**Overall, all distractors are clearly incorrect, but Distractor 1 is the most plausible in context, while Distractors 2 and 3 are moderately plausible.**
