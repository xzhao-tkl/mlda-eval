sentence: 腹部CT・腹部USにて胆嚢軸捻転と診断され,胆嚢摘出術を施行した.
triple: {'subject': '胆嚢軸捻転', 'relation': 'の診断に用いられる', 'object': '腹部CTおよび腹部超音波検査（US）'}
question: 腹部CTや腹部超音波検査（US）が診断に用いられる疾患は何ですか？
distractor 1: 胆石症
distractor 2: 急性膵炎
distractor 3: 肝細胞癌

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 胆石症 (Gallstones)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Gallstones are a common biliary disease. Abdominal CT and US are standard diagnostic tools for gallstones. The question asks for a disease diagnosed by these modalities, and gallstones fit perfectly in terms of subject, relation, and expected answer type. This could easily confuse even experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify "胆嚢軸捻転" (gallbladder torsion) as the disease diagnosed by CT/US. Gallstones are a different entity, so this distractor is clearly incorrect for this specific sentence/triple.

---

## Distractor 2: 急性膵炎 (Acute Pancreatitis)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Acute pancreatitis is often evaluated with abdominal CT and US, but these modalities are not the primary diagnostic tools (lab findings and clinical presentation are more central). Still, it is plausible in the biomedical context and fits the expected answer type, though less directly than gallstones.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence/triple is about gallbladder torsion, not pancreatitis. While CT/US can be used in pancreatitis, the sentence does not support this as the answer, so it is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 肝細胞癌 (Hepatocellular Carcinoma)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Hepatocellular carcinoma is a liver disease, and abdominal CT/US are used for its diagnosis. However, the question is about diseases diagnosed by these modalities, so it is plausible but less directly related to the gallbladder context than the other options.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence/triple is about gallbladder torsion, not liver cancer. This distractor is definitely incorrect for the specific context.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor      | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 胆石症          | 3            | Fits context, very plausible | 3             | Clearly not the original answer |
| 急性膵炎        | 2            | Plausible, but less direct | 3             | Clearly not the original answer |
| 肝細胞癌        | 2            | Plausible, but less related | 3             | Clearly not the original answer |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are incorrect for the original sentence/triple, and all are plausible biomedical diseases that could be diagnosed by CT/US, though with varying degrees of directness. "胆石症" is the most plausible, while "急性膵炎" and "肝細胞癌" are moderately plausible. None are ambiguous or partially correct for the specific context.
