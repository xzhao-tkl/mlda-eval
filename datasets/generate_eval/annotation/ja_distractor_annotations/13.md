sentence: HPC1, 4, 5はFII, FXとも反応し, この反応性はGla残基の化学修飾に伴い消失した.
triple: {'subject': 'HPC1, 4, 5', 'relation': 'は反応する', 'object': 'FIIおよびFX'}
question: HPC1, 4, 5が反応する血液凝固因子はどれですか？
distractor 1: FVIIIおよびFIX
distractor 2: FIIIおよびFV
distractor 3: FVIIおよびFXI

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: FVIIIおよびFIX

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** FVIII (Factor VIII) and FIX (Factor IX) are both blood coagulation factors, just like FII and FX. They are commonly discussed together in biomedical contexts (e.g., hemophilia). The question asks which coagulation factors HPC1, 4, 5 react with, so FVIII and FIX are very plausible as alternative answers.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that HPC1, 4, 5 react with FII and FX, not FVIII and FIX. There is no mention of FVIII or FIX in the original sentence, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: FIIIおよびFV

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** FV (Factor V) is a real coagulation factor, but "FIII" is not a standard designation in human coagulation (FIII is sometimes used for tissue factor, but it's not a common term in this context). This makes the pair less plausible than distractor 1, but still somewhat plausible because FV is relevant.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention FIII or FV as factors that HPC1, 4, 5 react with. Therefore, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: FVIIおよびFXI

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** FVII (Factor VII) and FXI (Factor XI) are both legitimate blood coagulation factors and are commonly discussed in the context of coagulation cascades. They fit the expected answer type and domain very well.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify FII and FX as the correct answer. FVII and FXI are not mentioned, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| FVIIIおよびFIX | 3 | Common coagulation factors, plausible alternative | 3 | Not mentioned, definitely wrong |
| FIIIおよびFV | 2 | FV is plausible, FIII less so | 3 | Not mentioned, definitely wrong |
| FVIIおよびFXI | 3 | Both are real coagulation factors, plausible | 3 | Not mentioned, definitely wrong |

## Overall Reasoning

All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence and triple. Distractors 1 and 3 are highly plausible because they use real, commonly referenced coagulation factors. Distractor 2 is less plausible due to the use of "FIII," which is not a standard term in this context, but still relevant due to FV. All distractors are appropriate for a biomedical multiple-choice question.
