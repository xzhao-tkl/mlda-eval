sentence: 細胞質内ではこれらのPUFAは特異的に脂肪酸結合タンパク質 (Fabp) と結合し, 細胞膜へ輸送されたり遺伝子発現に関わる。
triple: {'subject': 'PUFA（多価不飽和脂肪酸）', 'relation': 'は細胞質内で特異的に結合し、細胞膜への輸送や遺伝子発現に関与する', 'object': '脂肪酸結合タンパク質（Fabp）'}
question: PUFA（多価不飽和脂肪酸）が細胞質内で特異的に結合するタンパク質は何ですか？
distractor 1: トランスフェリン
distractor 2: アルブミン
distractor 3: グロブリン

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: トランスフェリン (Transferrin)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**  
**Reason:**  
Transferrin is a well-known protein in the biomedical field, primarily involved in iron transport. While it is not related to fatty acid binding, its status as a transport protein makes it a somewhat plausible distractor for someone who knows proteins but not the specific function. It fits the expected answer type (protein), but domain experts would rule it out quickly.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reason:**  
The original sentence and triple clearly state that PUFA binds specifically to fatty acid binding proteins (Fabp), not transferrin. There is no ambiguity; transferrin is not involved in this process.

---

## Distractor 2: アルブミン (Albumin)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**  
**Reason:**  
Albumin is a major plasma protein known to bind various fatty acids and transport them in the blood. In some contexts, albumin is associated with fatty acid transport, making it a very convincing distractor, especially for those with biomedical knowledge. It fits the subject, relation, and expected answer type very well.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 2 (Likely wrong)**  
**Reason:**  
While albumin does bind fatty acids, the sentence specifies "細胞質内" (in the cytoplasm) and "特異的に" (specifically), referring to Fabp, not albumin. Albumin is mainly extracellular (in plasma), so it is likely wrong, but the overlap in function creates some ambiguity for non-experts.

---

## Distractor 3: グロブリン (Globulin)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**  
**Reason:**  
Globulin is a general class of proteins, some of which are involved in transport or immune functions. While it is a protein and could be considered in a biomedical context, it is not specifically known for fatty acid binding in the cytoplasm, making it moderately plausible.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reason:**  
The original sentence and triple do not support globulin as the correct answer. There is no evidence or ambiguity; globulin is not the protein that PUFA binds to in the cytoplasm.

## Summary Table

| Distractor      | Plausibility | Reason (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reason (Incorrectness) |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| トランスフェリン | 2            | Known transport protein, but not for fatty acids | 3             | Clearly not involved in PUFA cytoplasmic binding |
| アルブミン      | 3            | Major fatty acid-binding protein, plausible confusion | 2             | Binds fatty acids but not in cytoplasm; some ambiguity |
| グロブリン      | 2            | General protein class, not specific to fatty acids | 3             | Not supported by sentence/triple, definitely wrong |

---

## Reasoning Summary

- **トランスフェリン** is a plausible distractor due to its transport function but is clearly incorrect for this context.
- **アルブミン** is highly plausible and could confuse even experts, but is not the correct cytoplasmic binding protein, though it does bind fatty acids in plasma.
- **グロブリン** is moderately plausible as a general protein but is definitely incorrect for the specific function described.

These distractors are well-chosen for a biomedical multiple-choice question, with albumin being the strongest distractor in terms of plausibility.
