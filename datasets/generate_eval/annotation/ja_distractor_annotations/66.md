sentence: 透析患者ではVLDL分画Apo B-48比 (Apo B-48/(Apo B-100+Apo B-48)) は健常人に比べ高値であり, さらに血漿TG値をマッチさせても透析患者のApo B-48比は健常人のそれに比べ高値であった.
triple: {'subject': '透析患者', 'relation': 'では', 'object': 'VLDL分画Apo B-48比 (Apo B-48/(Apo B-100+Apo B-48)) が健常人に比べ高値である'}
question: 健常人と比較して高値を示すのは透析患者のどの指標ですか？
distractor 1: LDL分画Apo B-100比 (Apo B-100/(Apo B-100+Apo B-48))
distractor 2: HDL分画Apo A-I比 (Apo A-I/(Apo A-I+Apo B-48))
distractor 3: 血漿総コレステロール値

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: LDL分画Apo B-100比 (Apo B-100/(Apo B-100+Apo B-48))

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** The distractor is very similar in structure to the correct answer, only substituting VLDL and Apo B-48 for LDL and Apo B-100. Both are lipoprotein fractions and relevant apolipoproteins in the biomedical context. This could easily confuse someone, especially since the formula is analogous.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically states that the VLDL分画Apo B-48比 is higher in dialysis patients compared to healthy controls, not the LDL分画Apo B-100比. There is no mention of LDL分画Apo B-100比 being elevated, so this is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: HDL分画Apo A-I比 (Apo A-I/(Apo A-I+Apo B-48))

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** HDL and Apo A-I are relevant in lipid metabolism and commonly measured in clinical settings. However, the original sentence focuses on VLDL and Apo B-48, so this is less directly related. Still, it is plausible as a distractor in a biomedical context.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention HDL分画Apo A-I比 at all, nor does it suggest that this ratio is elevated in dialysis patients. Therefore, this is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 血漿総コレステロール値

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Plasma total cholesterol is a standard clinical measurement and could be considered when comparing lipid profiles between patient groups. However, the sentence is specifically about a ratio involving apolipoproteins in VLDL, not total cholesterol, so this is less plausible than distractor 1.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not state that total cholesterol is higher in dialysis patients compared to healthy controls; it only discusses the VLDL分画Apo B-48比. Thus, this is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| 1 (LDL分画Apo B-100比) | 3 | Formula/structure is analogous and domain-relevant | 3 | Not supported by sentence, clearly not the answer |
| 2 (HDL分画Apo A-I比) | 2 | Related to lipid metabolism, but less direct | 3 | Not mentioned or implied in sentence |
| 3 (血漿総コレステロール値) | 2 | Standard clinical measure, but not specific to prompt | 3 | Not discussed in sentence, clearly not the answer |

---

**Overall, all distractors are clearly incorrect, but Distractor 1 is the most plausible and could easily confuse test-takers. Distractors 2 and 3 are moderately plausible due to their relevance in lipid metabolism and clinical practice, but are less directly related to the specific ratio discussed in the prompt.**
