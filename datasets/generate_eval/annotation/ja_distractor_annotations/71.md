sentence: 3. 貯蔵中のVCの減少には,茶葉内の糖濃度が影響する。
triple: {'subject': '茶葉内の糖濃度', 'relation': 'は影響する', 'object': '貯蔵中のVC（ビタミンC）の減少'}
question: 貯蔵中のVC（ビタミンC）の減少に影響を与える茶葉内の要因は何ですか？
distractor 1: 茶葉内のタンパク質濃度
distractor 2: 茶葉内の水分含量
distractor 3: 茶葉内のカフェイン濃度

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 茶葉内のタンパク質濃度 (Protein concentration in tea leaves)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Protein concentration is a reasonable biochemical factor that could plausibly affect the stability or degradation of vitamin C during storage. While not as directly relevant as sugar concentration (the correct answer), it is a plausible distractor in the context of tea leaf composition and storage effects.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple specify that sugar concentration is the influencing factor, not protein. There is no evidence in the sentence that protein concentration affects vitamin C loss, so this is clearly incorrect.

## Distractor 2: 茶葉内の水分含量 (Moisture content in tea leaves)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Moisture content is a very convincing distractor. Water content is commonly associated with chemical stability and degradation processes during storage, including vitamin C loss. This could easily confuse even experts and fits the domain and context well.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence only mentions sugar concentration as the influencing factor, not moisture. Therefore, this is definitely incorrect for the given prompt.

## Distractor 3: 茶葉内のカフェイン濃度 (Caffeine concentration in tea leaves)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Caffeine is a well-known compound in tea leaves, and its concentration could be considered as a possible factor affecting other chemical changes. However, it is less directly related to vitamin C degradation than moisture or sugar, but still plausible enough for a distractor.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention caffeine as an influencing factor for vitamin C loss. Thus, this is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| タンパク質濃度 | 2 | Biochemically plausible, but less direct than sugar or moisture | 3 | Not supported by the sentence |
| 水分含量 | 3 | Highly plausible, fits domain and context well | 3 | Not supported by the sentence |
| カフェイン濃度 | 2 | Plausible, but less direct than other factors | 3 | Not supported by the sentence |

## Overall Reasoning

All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence, which only supports sugar concentration as the influencing factor. In terms of plausibility, moisture content is the strongest distractor, as it is highly relevant to chemical stability during storage. Protein and caffeine concentrations are moderately plausible, as they are common tea leaf components but less directly associated with vitamin C degradation. None of the distractors are implausible or irrelevant.
