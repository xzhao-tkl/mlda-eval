sentence: 著者らは, フィチン酸のイノシトール骨格に着目し, フィチン酸がミオイノシトールと同様に抗脂肪肝作用を有することや, フィチン酸によるこの効果が現実に摂取しているレベル付近で発揮されることを明らかにした。
triple: {'subject': 'フィチン酸', 'relation': 'は有する', 'object': '抗脂肪肝作用'}
question: フィチン酸が有すると明らかにされた作用は何ですか？
distractor 1: 抗酸化作用
distractor 2: 抗糖尿病作用
distractor 3: 抗高血圧作用

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 抗酸化作用 (Antioxidant effect)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** In biomedical literature, "抗酸化作用" is a common effect attributed to many compounds, including those similar to フィチン酸 (phytic acid). It fits the expected answer type (a biological effect), and could plausibly be confused with the correct answer, especially since antioxidant effects are often discussed alongside metabolic effects.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple clearly state that the effect is "抗脂肪肝作用" (anti-fatty liver effect), not "抗酸化作用". There is no mention of antioxidant effect in the sentence, so this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 抗糖尿病作用 (Anti-diabetic effect)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "抗糖尿病作用" is another effect often discussed in relation to metabolic compounds like phytic acid. It is a plausible answer in the biomedical context and fits the expected answer type, making it a convincing distractor.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence and triple do not mention anti-diabetic effects; the only effect clarified is anti-fatty liver. Thus, this distractor is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 抗高血圧作用 (Anti-hypertensive effect)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** "抗高血圧作用" is also a common effect discussed for various bioactive compounds. It fits the biomedical context and the expected answer type, and could plausibly be confused with the correct answer.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence and triple do not mention anti-hypertensive effects; only anti-fatty liver effect is specified. This distractor is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 抗酸化作用         | 3            | Common effect, fits context, plausible | 3             | Not mentioned, clearly not the answer |
| 抗糖尿病作用       | 3            | Common metabolic effect, plausible | 3             | Not mentioned, clearly not the answer |
| 抗高血圧作用       | 3            | Common effect, fits context, plausible | 3             | Not mentioned, clearly not the answer |

## **Overall Reasoning**
All distractors are highly plausible in the biomedical context and fit the expected answer type, making them convincing options. None of them are supported by the original sentence or triple, so they are all definitely incorrect. This is a well-constructed set of distractors for a biomedical multiple-choice question.
