sentence: Vascular failureによる急性心不全ではHD患者においても血管拡張薬による初期治療が有用であり, またHD患者で報告の多い交感神経の活動亢進が誘因の一つとされる.
triple: {'subject': 'Vascular failureによる急性心不全のHD患者', 'relation': 'において初期治療として有用なのは', 'object': '血管拡張薬'}
question: Vascular failureによる急性心不全のHD患者に対して初期治療として有用とされる薬剤は何ですか？
distractor 1: 利尿薬
distractor 2: β遮断薬
distractor 3: 抗不整脈薬

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 利尿薬 (Diuretics)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Diuretics are commonly used in the management of heart failure, including acute settings, and are a standard treatment in HD (hemodialysis) patients for fluid overload. Given the context of acute heart failure, this is a very plausible option and could easily confuse even experts.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence specifically states that vasodilators (血管拡張薬) are useful for initial treatment in this scenario. Diuretics are not mentioned as the initial treatment for vascular failure-induced acute heart failure in HD patients, so this is definitely incorrect.

## Distractor 2: β遮断薬 (Beta-blockers)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Beta-blockers are used in chronic heart failure and sometimes in acute settings, especially when sympathetic overactivity is present (which is mentioned in the sentence). However, they are not typically the initial treatment for acute heart failure due to vascular failure, especially in HD patients. Still, their use in heart failure makes them a plausible distractor.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not support beta-blockers as the initial treatment; it specifically highlights vasodilators. Therefore, this is definitely incorrect.

---

## Distractor 3: 抗不整脈薬 (Antiarrhythmic drugs)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** Antiarrhythmic drugs are used in cardiac patients, especially if arrhythmias are present, but they are not standard initial therapy for acute heart failure due to vascular failure. Their relevance is less direct, but they are still plausible in a cardiac context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The original sentence does not mention arrhythmias or antiarrhythmic drugs as initial therapy. Thus, this is definitely incorrect.

## Summary Table

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 利尿薬             | 3            | Standard heart failure drug, fits context well | 3             | Not supported by sentence, not initial therapy here |
| β遮断薬            | 2            | Used in heart failure, plausible but less so for initial therapy | 3             | Not supported by sentence, not initial therapy here |
| 抗不整脈薬         | 2            | Cardiac drug, plausible but not standard for this scenario | 3             | Not supported by sentence, not initial therapy here |

## Overall Reasoning

All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence, which specifically supports vasodilators as the initial therapy. In terms of plausibility, diuretics are the most convincing distractor due to their common use in heart failure, while beta-blockers and antiarrhythmics are moderately plausible due to their general cardiac relevance but less so for the specific scenario described. None of the distractors are implausible or irrelevant.
