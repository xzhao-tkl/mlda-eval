sentence: 通常用いられている100°C塩酸酸性加熱抽出では, 電気泳動における移動度が変化することがあり, 時には同型の抗血清との反応が認められないこともあった.50°C塩酸酸性加熱抽出および高圧加熱抽出した抗原は, 交差反応もなく, また, 反応性も強く, CIE法に用いる抗原として適しているが, 操作の容易さの点から, 高圧加熱抽出法が奨められる.
triple: {'subject': '高圧加熱抽出法', 'relation': 'は奨められる', 'object': 'CIE法に用いる抗原の抽出方法として'}
question: CIE法に用いる抗原の抽出方法として操作が容易で奨められるのはどの抽出法ですか？
distractor 1: 100°C塩酸酸性加熱抽出法
distractor 2: 50°C塩酸酸性加熱抽出法
distractor 3: 酵素分解抽出法

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria: **Plausibility in Context** and **Incorrectness**.

---

## Distractor 1: 100°C塩酸酸性加熱抽出法

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** This method is explicitly mentioned in the sentence as a commonly used extraction method for antigens. It is a reasonable candidate for the question about recommended extraction methods for CIE antigens, especially since the sentence discusses its use and limitations. It fits the expected answer type and domain.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence states that this method can cause changes in electrophoretic mobility and sometimes fails to react with homologous antisera, implying it is *not* recommended. The correct answer is "高圧加熱抽出法," so this distractor is clearly incorrect.

---

## Distractor 2: 50°C塩酸酸性加熱抽出法

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 3 (Highly plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** This method is also discussed in the sentence as producing strong reactivity and no cross-reaction, making it suitable for CIE antigens. It is a plausible answer, as the sentence says it is suitable, but the final recommendation is for the high-pressure method due to ease of operation.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 2 (Likely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence says this method is suitable for CIE antigens, but the high-pressure method is recommended for ease of operation. This distractor is not the recommended method, but it is not entirely incorrect, as it is suitable. Thus, it is "likely wrong" rather than "definitely wrong."

---

## Distractor 3: 酵素分解抽出法

### 1) Plausibility in Context
- **Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**
- **Reasoning:** This method is not mentioned in the sentence, but it is a known extraction method in biomedicine. It is plausible as a distractor because someone might consider it, but it is less convincing than the other two, which are directly discussed in the context.

### 2) Incorrectness
- **Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**
- **Reasoning:** The sentence does not mention this method at all, and it is not supported as a recommended method for CIE antigens. Therefore, it is definitely incorrect.

## **Summary Table**

| Distractor | Plausibility | Reason | Incorrectness | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|---------------|--------|
| 100°C塩酸酸性加熱抽出法 | 3 | Directly discussed, plausible candidate | 3 | Explicitly not recommended |
| 50°C塩酸酸性加熱抽出法 | 3 | Discussed as suitable, plausible | 2 | Suitable but not recommended |
| 酵素分解抽出法 | 2 | Known method, not mentioned in context | 3 | Not supported by sentence |

---

## **Overall Reasoning**
- Distractors 1 and 2 are highly plausible because they are directly discussed in the sentence and fit the context of antigen extraction for CIE.
- Distractor 3 is moderately plausible due to its general relevance in the domain, but it is not mentioned in the sentence.
- All distractors are incorrect, but Distractor 2 is only "likely wrong" because the sentence says it is suitable, just not recommended for ease of operation. The other two are "definitely wrong" as per the sentence's content.
