sentence: しかし頭頸部癌症例の場合,遠隔転移を有していても,原発巣や頸部リンパ節転移による,窒息や出血や嚥下不能状態を回避することは,Quality of Life(QOL)維持に欠かせず,局所制御も重要な課題となる。
triple: {'subject': '頭頸部癌症例（遠隔転移を有する場合）', 'relation': 'において重要となるのは', 'object': '原発巣や頸部リンパ節転移による窒息・出血・嚥下不能状態の回避とQuality of Life(QOL)の維持、局所制御'}
question: 頭頸部癌症例（遠隔転移を有する場合）で、原発巣や頸部リンパ節転移による窒息や出血、嚥下不能状態を回避することが欠かせないのは何の維持のためですか？
distractor 1: 治癒率
distractor 2: 免疫機能
distractor 3: 腫瘍縮小効果

Let's evaluate each distractor according to the two criteria:

---

## Distractor 1: 治癒率 (Cure rate)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
- "治癒率" (cure rate) is a common goal in cancer treatment and is relevant in the biomedical context.
- However, the prompt specifically discusses "Quality of Life (QOL)" maintenance, not cure. In cases with distant metastasis, cure is often not the main goal, but symptom control and QOL are.
- Still, a non-expert might plausibly confuse "cure rate" as a reason for avoiding severe symptoms.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
- The original sentence and triple clearly state that the reason for avoiding symptoms is QOL maintenance, not cure rate.
- "治癒率" is not supported by the sentence and is not the correct answer.

---

## Distractor 2: 免疫機能 (Immune function)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 1 (Barely plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
- "免疫機能" (immune function) is a biomedical term, but it is not directly related to the context of avoiding airway obstruction, bleeding, or dysphagia in head and neck cancer with distant metastasis.
- The connection is weak; immune function is not typically the reason for these interventions.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
- The sentence does not mention immune function as a reason for symptom control.
- It is clearly not the correct answer.

---

## Distractor 3: 腫瘍縮小効果 (Tumor shrinkage effect)

### 1) Plausibility in Context
**Score: 2 (Moderately plausible)**  
**Reasoning:**  
- "腫瘍縮小効果" (tumor shrinkage effect) is a plausible goal in cancer therapy and is relevant in the biomedical context.
- However, the prompt is about avoiding life-threatening symptoms and maintaining QOL, not directly about tumor shrinkage.
- Some might confuse tumor shrinkage with symptom control, but the sentence is more about QOL.

### 2) Incorrectness
**Score: 3 (Definitely wrong)**  
**Reasoning:**  
- The original sentence does not state that tumor shrinkage is the reason for avoiding these symptoms.
- The correct answer is QOL maintenance, so this is definitely wrong.

## Summary Table

| Distractor         | Plausibility | Reasoning (Plausibility) | Incorrectness | Reasoning (Incorrectness) |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 治癒率             | 2            | Relevant but not the main goal in this context | 3             | Clearly not supported by the sentence |
| 免疫機能           | 1            | Weak connection to context | 3             | Not mentioned or implied in the sentence |
| 腫瘍縮小効果       | 2            | Related to cancer therapy, but not the main focus here | 3             | Not the reason stated in the sentence |

## Overall Reasoning

- All distractors are clearly incorrect based on the original sentence and triple.
- "治癒率" and "腫瘍縮小効果" are moderately plausible as they are common terms in cancer care, but do not fit the specific context of QOL maintenance in metastatic head and neck cancer.
- "免疫機能" is barely plausible, as it is not relevant to the specific clinical scenario described.
