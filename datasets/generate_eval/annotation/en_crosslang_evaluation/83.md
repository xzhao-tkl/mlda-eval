## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Reasoning

The English triple is:
- **Subject:** many physical therapists
- **Relation:** experience decreased work performance due to
- **Object:** low back pain

The Japanese abstract states:
- The purpose is to investigate the frequency and degree of decreased work performance due to low back pain among physical therapists in Japan.
- The subjects were 378 physical therapists.
- Using a questionnaire, they evaluated the degree of decreased work performance due to low back pain, the degree of low back pain, age, years of experience, and gender.
- Results: 46.0% of all subjects showed decreased work performance due to low back pain.
- There was a significant positive correlation between decreased work performance due to low back pain and the degree of low back pain.
- Conclusion: It was shown that decreased work performance due to low back pain is not uncommon among physical therapists.

The key sentence is:  
"対象者全体の46.0％に腰痛による業務遂行能力低下が認められた．"  
Translation: "46.0% of all subjects showed decreased work performance due to low back pain."

This directly matches the English triple: many physical therapists (46% is "many") experience decreased work performance due to low back pain.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence(s)

- "対象者全体の46.0％に腰痛による業務遂行能力低下が認められた．"
