Japanese abstract: PFDは一般に中等度以上の膵外分泌機能障害で明らかに異常を示すが,膵疾患以外の疾患(n=55)でも24%に異常が認められ,特に腎機能障害および肝機能障害では,健常者に比べて有意に低値を示した.健常者でも70歳以上では明らかに低下した.一方,PFDにPABA吸収試験を併用し,その比(PFDIPABA)でみると健常群に比べて膵外分泌機能障害群だけが有意に低下し,他の疾患群では有意の差はなくなり,各年代においても有意の差は認めなくなつた.それゆえ,PFDにPABA吸収試験を併用することにより,膵外分泌機能障害以外の影響因子を除外できる.すなわち,PFDの膵外分泌機能検査としての特異性を高めることにより診断能を向上させることができる.
English triple: {'subject': 'PFD, an oral exocrine pancreatic function test', 'relation': 'is considered valuable in', 'object': 'clinical practice'}

**Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation**

**Step 1: Understanding the English Triple**
- **Subject:** PFD, an oral exocrine pancreatic function test
- **Relation:** is considered valuable in
- **Object:** clinical practice

This triple asserts that the PFD test is valuable for use in clinical practice.

**Step 2: Analyzing the Japanese Abstract**

Key points from the abstract:
- PFD shows clear abnormalities in moderate or greater exocrine pancreatic dysfunction.
- In non-pancreatic diseases, 24% also showed abnormalities, especially in renal and hepatic dysfunction, with significantly lower values compared to healthy individuals.
- In healthy individuals over 70, values also decreased.
- When PABA absorption test is combined with PFD (PFD/PABA ratio), only the exocrine pancreatic dysfunction group showed significant decrease, and differences in other disease groups and age groups disappeared.
- Therefore, combining PFD with the PABA absorption test can exclude non-pancreatic factors.
- This increases the specificity of PFD as a test for exocrine pancreatic function and improves diagnostic ability.

**Step 3: Reasoning**

- The abstract discusses the diagnostic utility of PFD, especially when combined with the PABA absorption test, in distinguishing exocrine pancreatic dysfunction from other causes.
- It states that this combination increases the specificity of PFD as a test for exocrine pancreatic function and improves diagnostic ability.
- This implies that PFD (especially when combined with PABA) is valuable in clinical practice for diagnosing exocrine pancreatic dysfunction.

**Step 4: Sentence Identification**

Relevant sentences:
- "それゆえ,PFDにPABA吸収試験を併用することにより,膵外分泌機能障害以外の影響因子を除外できる.すなわち,PFDの膵外分泌機能検査としての特異性を高めることにより診断能を向上させることができる."
  - Translation: "Therefore, by combining PFD with the PABA absorption test, it is possible to exclude factors other than exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. That is, by increasing the specificity of PFD as a test for exocrine pancreatic function, diagnostic ability can be improved."

**Step 5: Scoring**

- The abstract does not state in one sentence that "PFD is valuable in clinical practice," but it does state that the test's specificity and diagnostic ability are improved, which is the basis for its value in clinical practice.
- This can be reasonably inferred from the paragraph as a whole.

**Score: 1 (Inferable)**

**Reasoning:**  
The abstract does not directly state that "PFD is valuable in clinical practice," but it does discuss how the test's specificity and diagnostic ability are improved, which supports its value in clinical practice. This is a reasonable inference from the content.

**Relevant sentences:**  
- "それゆえ,PFDにPABA吸収試験を併用することにより,膵外分泌機能障害以外の影響因子を除外できる.すなわち,PFDの膵外分泌機能検査としての特異性を高めることにより診断能を向上させることができる."
