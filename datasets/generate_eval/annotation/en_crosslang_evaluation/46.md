Japanese abstract: 脳塞栓症で右中大脳動脈 (MCA) 穿通枝領域に著明なcapillary blushを認めた1例を報告する.症例は心房細動を有する57歳男性で, 左不全片麻痺を主訴として入院した.CTにて右基底核部を中心に比較的大きな低吸収域を認め, 臨床的に心由来の脳塞栓症が考えられた.発症12時間後に施行した脳血管撮影では, MCA分枝閉塞とその後方部分への皮質枝吻合を介する側副血行を認め, また動脈相で基底核部に著明なcapillary blushと視床線条体静脈・Rosenthal静脈の早期出現を認めた.後者の所見は第8病日でもみられたが, 臨床症状はこの時までに徐々に改善した.第33病日の血管撮影, CT所見ではほとんど異常を認めなかった.以上からMCA水平部の再開通が早期に起こったため, 穿通枝領域の虚血が軽かったことを示し, capillary blushの出現は, この領域で壊死や強い浮腫を生ずることなく, 血管系が一時的な機能障害に陥ったと考えられる所見であった.
English triple: {'subject': 'capillary blush and early venous filling', 'relation': 'are frequently observed following', 'object': 'reopening of ischemic regions caused by cerebral embolism'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Step 1: Understanding the English Triple

- **Subject:** capillary blush and early venous filling
- **Relation:** are frequently observed following
- **Object:** reopening of ischemic regions caused by cerebral embolism

This triple states that after reopening (recanalization) of brain regions that were ischemic due to cerebral embolism, capillary blush and early venous filling are frequently seen.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Japanese Abstract

Key points from the abstract:
- The case is a 57-year-old man with atrial fibrillation, admitted for left hemiparesis.
- CT showed a large low-density area in the right basal ganglia, clinically considered a cardiogenic cerebral embolism.
- 12 hours after onset, cerebral angiography showed MCA branch occlusion, collateral circulation via cortical branches, and *marked capillary blush* and *early appearance of thalamostriate and Rosenthal veins* in the basal ganglia.
- These findings persisted until day 8, but clinical symptoms gradually improved.
- By day 33, angiography and CT were almost normal.
- The authors conclude that early recanalization of the MCA horizontal segment led to mild ischemia in the perforator territory, and the appearance of capillary blush indicates temporary vascular dysfunction without necrosis or severe edema.

### Step 3: Matching the Triple

#### Direct Match?
- The abstract does not state *frequently observed* as a general rule, but describes a specific case.
- It does describe *capillary blush and early venous filling* (早期出現) after *reopening* (再開通) of an ischemic region due to cerebral embolism.

#### Inferable?
- The abstract describes the sequence: embolic occlusion → ischemia → recanalization (reopening) → capillary blush and early venous filling observed.
- The authors interpret the capillary blush as a sign of temporary vascular dysfunction after early recanalization, which matches the triple's implication.

#### Not Supported?
- The only limitation is that the abstract is a case report, not a general statement about frequency.

### Step 4: Scoring

**Score: 1 (Inferable)**

- The triple is not stated as a general rule, but the described case supports the inference that capillary blush and early venous filling are observed following reopening of ischemic regions caused by cerebral embolism.

### Step 5: Identifying Supporting Sentences

**Supporting sentences:**
- "発症12時間後に施行した脳血管撮影では, MCA分枝閉塞とその後方部分への皮質枝吻合を介する側副血行を認め, また動脈相で基底核部に著明なcapillary blushと視床線条体静脈・Rosenthal静脈の早期出現を認めた."
  - (At 12 hours after onset, angiography showed MCA branch occlusion, collateral flow, and marked capillary blush and early appearance of thalamostriate and Rosenthal veins.)
- "以上からMCA水平部の再開通が早期に起こったため, 穿通枝領域の虚血が軽かったことを示し, capillary blushの出現は, この領域で壊死や強い浮腫を生ずることなく, 血管系が一時的な機能障害に陥ったと考えられる所見であった."
  - (The early recanalization of the MCA horizontal segment led to mild ischemia, and the appearance of capillary blush is considered a sign of temporary vascular dysfunction without necrosis or severe edema.)

### Reasoning Summary

The Japanese abstract describes a case where capillary blush and early venous filling were observed after reopening of an ischemic region caused by cerebral embolism. While it does not generalize this as "frequently observed," the sequence and interpretation match the triple's meaning, making it inferable.
