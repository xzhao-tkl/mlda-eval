English abstract: Influences of environmental factors such as temperature, soil moisture and soil pH on the viability of resting spores of Plasmodiophora brassicae incubated in sterile soil were examined by using the direct method based on the fluorescent staining reaction in spores. When resting spores were incubated in acid soil, the frequency of nonviable spores increased readily and profusely after incubation and reached approximately 70 to 80% after a 30-day incubation. The rate of the increase was not appreciably affected by temperatures between 15 and 30°C and by soil moisture contents between 35 and 100% during the 30-day incubation, though affected slightly by low temperature and moisture content. The temperatures and soil moistures in the range tested were not so important factor as affecting the viability of resting spores. On the other hand, soil pH distinctly affected spore viability. A remarkable increase in the nonviable spore frequency was found in acid soils with pH values of approximately 4.5-6.5. In alkali soils the rate of increase was conspicuously low in the beginning of incubation period as compared with those in acid soils, but then the nonviable spore frequency increased continuously at an almost constant rate during a 7-month incubation. The soil pH is one of important factors affecting the viability of resting spores, but may not be the determinate factor in their survival due to lack of ability to suppress independently the decline of the viability during a long period of time.

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 培養直後の不活性胞子の割合の増加 (Increase in the proportion of nonviable spores immediately after incubation)
- **Relation:** は影響される (is affected by)
- **Object:** 土壌pH（特にpH約4.5〜6.5の酸性土壌） (soil pH, especially acidic soil with pH about 4.5–6.5)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Relevant Sentences:
1. "When resting spores were incubated in acid soil, the frequency of nonviable spores increased readily and profusely after incubation and reached approximately 70 to 80% after a 30-day incubation."
2. "On the other hand, soil pH distinctly affected spore viability. A remarkable increase in the nonviable spore frequency was found in acid soils with pH values of approximately 4.5-6.5."

#### Reasoning
- The abstract directly states that the frequency (proportion) of nonviable spores increases after incubation in acid soil (pH 4.5–6.5).
- It also explicitly says that soil pH affects spore viability, with a remarkable increase in nonviable spores in acidic soils of pH 4.5–6.5.
- The Japanese triple matches this information: the increase in nonviable spores after incubation is affected by soil pH, especially in acidic soils (pH 4.5–6.5).

### Score: **2 (Direct match)**

#### Supporting Sentences:
- "When resting spores were incubated in acid soil, the frequency of nonviable spores increased readily and profusely after incubation and reached approximately 70 to 80% after a 30-day incubation."
- "A remarkable increase in the nonviable spore frequency was found in acid soils with pH values of approximately 4.5-6.5."

### Conclusion
The Japanese triple is **directly supported** by the English abstract, with clear and explicit statements about the effect of soil pH (especially pH 4.5–6.5) on the increase in nonviable spores after incubation.
