English abstract: The nickel excess symptom of mulberry plant was found out first in 1966 by the authors at mulberry field of serpentineous soil at Yabu-Gun, Hyogo Prefecture. In this paper, the appearances of mulberry plants suffered from nickel toxicity were described and the chemical properties of the serpentineous soils and the injured mulberry plants were discussed. (1) Nickel excess symptoms of mulberry plant, characterized by brown or dark brown intervenal necrosis of leaves usually appear at the leaves on shoots developed after Natsugiri, summer prunning, severely in the middle or toward the end of July. The leaves developed after that become gradually green and have normal appearances. Typical features of injured mulberry plants in the middle of July are: light yellowing leaves at the upper about one third on shoots, development of brownish or dark brownish necrotic area between leaf veins at the middle about one third on shoots and the leaves of lower about one third on shoots with transitional color from light green to green. (2) Symptoms just like to zinc and iron deficiencies were also found out at the same field. (3) The surface soil, cultivated layer, of the field was very acidic and its base saturation degree was also very low, but the acidity decreased with increasing depth. Relative content of magnesium in exchangeable bases of soil was markedly increased with increasing depth. Exchangeable nickel content of soils ranged from 3.0 to 34.2ppm and was generally higher at the layer adjacent to surface soil. (4) Calcium and magnesium contents in leaf blades, midribs and shoots were slightly higher in damaged plants than one with normal appearances. Nickel contents were generally higher in leaf blades among these three organs and ranged from about 20 to 50ppm, although differed according to leaf location on shoot and degree of damage. The severer degree of damage judged by appearances the higher nickel content in leaf blade, but the lower zinc content.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '下層土の塩基組成', 'relation': 'では', 'object': 'マグネシウムの占める割合が高くなる'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 下層土の塩基組成 (Base composition of subsoil)
- **Relation:** では (in/with respect to)
- **Object:** マグネシウムの占める割合が高くなる (the proportion of magnesium becomes higher)

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant part from the abstract:
> "Relative content of magnesium in exchangeable bases of soil was markedly increased with increasing depth."

#### Reasoning
- The Japanese triple states that in the base composition of subsoil, the proportion of magnesium becomes higher.
- The English abstract directly states that the relative content of magnesium in exchangeable bases of soil increases with depth.
- "Increasing depth" refers to subsoil (lower layers), and "relative content" matches "proportion."
- This is a direct match: the same knowledge is clearly expressed in one sentence.

#### Sentence Identification
- The relevant sentence is:  
  "Relative content of magnesium in exchangeable bases of soil was markedly increased with increasing depth."

### Score
**Score = 2** (Direct match)

### Summary
- The knowledge triple is directly supported by the English abstract.
- The relevant sentence is: "Relative content of magnesium in exchangeable bases of soil was markedly increased with increasing depth."
