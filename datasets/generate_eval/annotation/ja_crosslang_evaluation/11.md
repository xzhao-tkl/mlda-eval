English abstract: A new classification of congenital and infantile hydrocephalus was proposed in a hope of the correlation with the estimated prognosis, namely, "Perspective Classification of Congenital and Infantile Hydrocephalus". This classification is based on the multifactorial aspects affecting prognosis of congenital hydrocephalus. Three major concepts are included in the items ; clinico-embryological stage (Stage I-V), clinico-pathological type (Type P ; primary, Type D ; dysgenetic, Type S ; secondary) and clinico-chronological category (Category F ; fetal, Category N ; neonatal, Category I ; infantile) . This newly proposed classification may be valuable to the discussion on the controversial problems regarding the prenatal/perinatal therapeutic management of hydrocephalus offering more clearly identified hydrocephalic state together with the estimated postnatal outcome.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '水頭症の分類法', 'relation': 'は', 'object': 'clinico-embryological stage（stage I〜V）、clinico-pathological type（type P: primary, type D: dysgenetic, type S: secondary）、clinico-chronological category（category F: fetal, category N: neonatal, category I: infantile）から構成される'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 水頭症の分類法 (Classification method of hydrocephalus)
- **Relation:** は (is/consists of)
- **Object:** clinico-embryological stage（stage I〜V）、clinico-pathological type（type P: primary, type D: dysgenetic, type S: secondary）、clinico-chronological category（category F: fetal, category N: neonatal, category I: infantile）から構成される (consists of clinico-embryological stage (I-V), clinico-pathological type (P: primary, D: dysgenetic, S: secondary), clinico-chronological category (F: fetal, N: neonatal, I: infantile))

### English Abstract Analysis
The abstract states:
> Three major concepts are included in the items ; clinico-embryological stage (Stage I-V), clinico-pathological type (Type P ; primary, Type D ; dysgenetic, Type S ; secondary) and clinico-chronological category (Category F ; fetal, Category N ; neonatal, Category I ; infantile).

This sentence directly matches the Japanese triple, as it lists the same three components of the classification method for hydrocephalus.

### Reasoning
- The subject ("classification method of hydrocephalus") is directly referenced as "A new classification of congenital and infantile hydrocephalus".
- The relation ("consists of") is expressed by "Three major concepts are included in the items".
- The object (the three categories and their subtypes) is explicitly listed in the same sentence.

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence(s)
> Three major concepts are included in the items ; clinico-embryological stage (Stage I-V), clinico-pathological type (Type P ; primary, Type D ; dysgenetic, Type S ; secondary) and clinico-chronological category (Category F ; fetal, Category N ; neonatal, Category I ; infantile).

**Summary:**  
The knowledge triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract, with all elements present in a single sentence.
