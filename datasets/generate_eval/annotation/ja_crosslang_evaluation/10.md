English abstract: According to the “Statistics of mortalities of malignant neoplasm” by the Japanese Welfare Mimistry, malignant tumors of the upper urinary tract are increasing in number. One hunderd and four cases of renal cell carcinoma, 48 cases of renal pelvic tumor, and 34 cases of ureteral tumor treated in our department from 1955 to 1977 were followed through 1979. The actual 5-year survival rate was 49% for renal pelvic tumor, 40% for renal cell carcinoma and 34% for ureteral tumor. The actual survival rate for high stage (P3+P4) renal cell carcinomas was 24%, as compared to 66% for low stage (P1+P2) renal cell carcinomas. The prognosis of high stage group of renal cell carcinomas treated with adjuvant therapy (mainly radiation therapy) was better than that without it. The actual survival rate for high grade (G3+G4) renal pelvic tumor was 36%, as compared to 77% for low grade (G1+G2) renal pelvic tumor. Concerning the high grade group, the prognosis of the group treated with operation alone was the best. The prognosis of the ureteral tumors was poor, and 5 of 6 patients who lived more than 5 years were treated with operation alone. On analysis of these results, we noted that ESR, RBC counts and α2-globulin are parameters to be considered in developing a prognosis.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '腎盂腫瘍のHigh grade群 (G3+G4)', 'relation': 'における5年実測生存率は', 'object': '36%であり、手術療法単独群の予後が良好であった'}

**Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation**

**Japanese triple:**  
- Subject: 腎盂腫瘍のHigh grade群 (G3+G4) (High grade group (G3+G4) of renal pelvic tumor)
- Relation: における5年実測生存率は (5-year actual survival rate is)
- Object: 36%であり、手術療法単独群の予後が良好であった (36%, and the prognosis of the group treated with operation alone was good)

**English abstract evidence:**
- "The actual survival rate for high grade (G3+G4) renal pelvic tumor was 36%, as compared to 77% for low grade (G1+G2) renal pelvic tumor."
- "Concerning the high grade group, the prognosis of the group treated with operation alone was the best."

**Reasoning:**
- The first sentence directly states that the 5-year actual survival rate for high grade (G3+G4) renal pelvic tumor is 36%, matching the first part of the Japanese triple.
- The second sentence states that, for the high grade group, the prognosis of the group treated with operation alone was the best, which matches the assertion that the prognosis for the operation-alone group was good.

**Score:** 2 (Direct match)

**Supporting sentences:**
1. "The actual survival rate for high grade (G3+G4) renal pelvic tumor was 36%, as compared to 77% for low grade (G1+G2) renal pelvic tumor."
2. "Concerning the high grade group, the prognosis of the group treated with operation alone was the best."

**Conclusion:**  
The Japanese triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract, with both the survival rate and the prognosis for the operation-alone group explicitly mentioned.
