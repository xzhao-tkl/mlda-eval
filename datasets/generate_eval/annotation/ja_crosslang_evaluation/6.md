English abstract: 1) Basic studies of electrode surface---Using a SEM, we have observed the surface of glassy carbon electrode after surface treatment to make porous surface. To reduce polarization losses, porous surface is inevitably necessary. But reduction of surface area as a adjunct to minimize stimulation threshold made polarization losses difficult to deduce. 2) Pulse duration versus polarization losses---To reduce polarization voltage, pulse duration and stimulation voltage should be reduced. 3) The right atrial stimulation and micro-floating---rate dependent threshold change was obseved during atrial pacing, even on the 7-10 days after implantation. The possible mechanism of this rate dependency was studied with animal experiments. 4) Impedance as a function of frequency---Six electrodes were studied. Some electrodes showed high impedance value of 4-11 k Ohms in the area of sensing frequency.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '分極電圧を小さくする', 'relation': 'ためには', 'object': 'porousな表面にすることが必要である'}

**Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation**

**Japanese Triple:**  
- Subject: 分極電圧を小さくする (To reduce polarization voltage)
- Relation: ためには (in order to)
- Object: porousな表面にすることが必要である (it is necessary to make the surface porous)

**English Abstract Analysis:**  
Let's look for the knowledge that "to reduce polarization voltage, it is necessary to make the surface porous."

**Relevant Sentences:**
1. "To reduce polarization losses, porous surface is inevitably necessary."
2. "But reduction of surface area as a adjunct to minimize stimulation threshold made polarization losses difficult to deduce."
3. "To reduce polarization voltage, pulse duration and stimulation voltage should be reduced."

**Reasoning:**  
- Sentence 1 directly states that a porous surface is necessary to reduce polarization losses.  
- The Japanese triple says "to reduce polarization voltage, it is necessary to make the surface porous."  
- In the context of electrode studies, "polarization losses" and "polarization voltage" are closely related concepts, often used interchangeably in this context.  
- The English abstract directly matches the Japanese triple in meaning, especially in sentence 1.

**Score:**  
**2: Direct match** — The same triple is clearly expressed in one sentence in the abstract.

**Supporting Sentence:**  
"To reduce polarization losses, porous surface is inevitably necessary."

**Conclusion:**  
The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly supported by the English abstract, specifically in the first sentence of the abstract.
