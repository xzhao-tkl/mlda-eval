English abstract: The aim of this study was to clarify whether a close macroscopic examination can detect gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) in the resected specimen intraoperatively, and can contribute to improving prognosis. In our series of 318 GBC's, we found 63 GBC's at the time of operation in that way. Of these 63 patients, 18 had early GBC and 33 had advanced GBC showing subserosal invasion (GBC-ss). The factors that made the preoperative diagnosis difficult were inability to detect lesions by US or X-ray examination, coexistent acute cholecystitis, gallstones, and debris. Operative procedures included 30 simple cholecystectomies, 4 standard radical cholecystectomies (SRC), 15 modified SRC, and 2 other procedures. The 5-year postoperative survival rate for patients with early GBC was excellent. There was a significant difference in 5-year survival rate for the patients with GBC-ss between simple cholecystectomy (31%), and either modified SRC or SRC (88%). These results suggest that it is mandatory to examine the mucosa of the resected gallbladder and diagnose GBC at the time of operation, and that a radical operation or re-operation for GBCs after close pathological examination is indispensable for good prognosis.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'ss癌（進展した胆嚢癌）', 'relation': 'の予後を改善するためには', 'object': '進展度に応じた術式の施行が必要である'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** ss癌（進展した胆嚢癌） (ss cancer [advanced gallbladder carcinoma])
- **Relation:** の予後を改善するためには (in order to improve prognosis)
- **Object:** 進展度に応じた術式の施行が必要である (it is necessary to perform surgical procedures according to the degree of progression)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Relevant Sentences:
1. "There was a significant difference in 5-year survival rate for the patients with GBC-ss between simple cholecystectomy (31%), and either modified SRC or SRC (88%)."
2. "These results suggest that it is mandatory to examine the mucosa of the resected gallbladder and diagnose GBC at the time of operation, and that a radical operation or re-operation for GBCs after close pathological examination is indispensable for good prognosis."

#### Reasoning:
- The abstract discusses the prognosis (5-year survival rate) for patients with advanced gallbladder carcinoma (GBC-ss).
- It shows that the type of surgical procedure (simple cholecystectomy vs. modified SRC or SRC) has a significant impact on prognosis.
- The conclusion states that radical operation or re-operation is indispensable for good prognosis, which implies that the surgical procedure should be chosen according to the degree of cancer progression.
- This matches the Japanese triple: for advanced gallbladder cancer (ss癌), improving prognosis requires performing surgical procedures appropriate to the degree of progression.

### Score: **2 (Direct match)**
- The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly and clearly expressed in the English abstract, especially in the sentences cited above.

#### Sentences Identified:
- "There was a significant difference in 5-year survival rate for the patients with GBC-ss between simple cholecystectomy (31%), and either modified SRC or SRC (88%)."
- "These results suggest that ... a radical operation or re-operation for GBCs after close pathological examination is indispensable for good prognosis."

### Final Evaluation
**Score:** 2  
**Reasoning:** The English abstract directly supports the Japanese triple, stating that for advanced gallbladder carcinoma, prognosis is improved by performing surgical procedures appropriate to the degree of progression.
