English abstract: The external and internal radiation doses were estimated for 15 residents who lived at around 37 km north-west from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant which released radioactive plume due to the accident on March 11, 2011. An interview has been performed to ask where they stayed and what they ate after the accident.  To estimate the external radiation dose for each person, the air dose rate at the person's yard was measured and cumulative dose up to the 54th day from the release has been calculated. With regard to the internal radiation dose, urinary bioassay method has been performed on the 54th day and the 78-85th day after the deposition, by using a low-background Ge spectrometer. As a result, the average external dose was 10.5mSv among the adults, and 6.3mSv among the children. The average committed effective dose from <134>Cs and <137>Cs was 0.055mSv among the adults and 0.034mSv among the children. <131>I was detected in five persons; four adults and one child. The average committed effective dose from <131>I was 2.5mSv among the adults and 2.2mSv of the child.  The ratio of external dose to internal dose from <134>Cs and <137>Cs ranged from 87:1 to 566:1 among them.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'セシウム134と137による内部被ばくの預託実効線量', 'relation': 'は推定された', 'object': '成人は平均0.055mSv、小児は0.034mSv'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** セシウム134と137による内部被ばくの預託実効線量 (Committed effective dose from Cs-134 and Cs-137 internal exposure)
- **Relation:** は推定された (was estimated)
- **Object:** 成人は平均0.055mSv、小児は0.034mSv (adults: average 0.055mSv, children: 0.034mSv)

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant sentences:
> The average committed effective dose from <134>Cs and <137>Cs was 0.055mSv among the adults and 0.034mSv among the children.

#### Reasoning
- The English abstract directly states the average committed effective dose from Cs-134 and Cs-137 for adults and children, with the exact values matching the Japanese triple.
- The triple is clearly and explicitly expressed in one sentence in the abstract.

### Score: **2** (Direct match)

#### Sentence(s) supporting the triple:
> The average committed effective dose from <134>Cs and <137>Cs was 0.055mSv among the adults and 0.034mSv among the children.

---

**Summary:**  
The knowledge triple is directly and explicitly supported by the English abstract, with the same values and context. Score: **2**.
