English abstract: Electroporation (EP) is a standard laboratory technique, which was originally developed for in vitro transfer of molecules into cells. This technique has been shown to increase the effect of chemotherapeutic agents by increasing the permeability of cell membranes. We have utilized the floor of mouth model in mice to examine the effect of electorochemotherapy against head and neck cancer. Bleomycin (BLM)(20μg/site) was injected directly into the inplanted tumors and electric fields 50V /cm, 100V/cm were given. The mice were sacrificed 8 days after therapy and the tumor volume, histopathological effect, Ki67 labeling index was analyzed, The combination of BLM and EP significantly inhibited tumor growth and cell proliferation compared to treatment by BLM or EP alone. Histologically, the combination of BLM and EP synergistically inhibited the invasion of tumor cells. This technique offers promising possibilities in the local treatment of head and neck cancer.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'エレクトロポレーション法とブレオマイシンなどの抗癌剤の併用', 'relation': 'により', 'object': '薬剤の抗腫瘍効果が高まる'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** エレクトロポレーション法とブレオマイシンなどの抗癌剤の併用 (Combination of electroporation and anticancer drugs such as bleomycin)
- **Relation:** により (by/through)
- **Object:** 薬剤の抗腫瘍効果が高まる (the antitumor effect of the drug is increased)

### English Abstract Analysis

The key knowledge in the triple is that the combination of electroporation (EP) and anticancer drugs (specifically bleomycin) increases the antitumor effect of the drug.

#### Relevant Sentences in the Abstract:
1. "This technique has been shown to increase the effect of chemotherapeutic agents by increasing the permeability of cell membranes."
2. "The combination of BLM and EP significantly inhibited tumor growth and cell proliferation compared to treatment by BLM or EP alone."
3. "Histologically, the combination of BLM and EP synergistically inhibited the invasion of tumor cells."

#### Reasoning

- Sentence 1 establishes that electroporation increases the effect of chemotherapeutic agents.
- Sentence 2 directly compares the combination (BLM + EP) to either treatment alone, showing a significant increase in antitumor effect (inhibition of tumor growth and cell proliferation).
- Sentence 3 further supports the synergistic effect on inhibiting tumor cell invasion.

The abstract clearly states that the combination of electroporation and bleomycin (an anticancer drug) increases the antitumor effect, matching the Japanese triple.

### Score: **2 (Direct match)**

#### Supporting Sentences:
- "The combination of BLM and EP significantly inhibited tumor growth and cell proliferation compared to treatment by BLM or EP alone."
- "Histologically, the combination of BLM and EP synergistically inhibited the invasion of tumor cells."

### Conclusion

The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract. The same triple can be found in one or more sentences in the abstract.
