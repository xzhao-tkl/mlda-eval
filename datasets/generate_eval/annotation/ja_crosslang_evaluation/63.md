English abstract: It is known that insulin response to the glucose load in non-diabetic obese persons becomes normal after a decrease in the body weight. However, changes in the insulin response of diabetic patients with a decrease in body weight due to diet regulation are not clarified as yet. Therefore, 22 cases of maturity-onset mild diabetes treated only by diet regulation were divided into group A (marked decrease in body weight) and group B (unmarked decrease in body weight) in order to compare the serum insulin response to glucose load (100 g) before and after a decrease in body weight. 1) In group A, the value for blood sugar showed a significant decrease at each measurement after a decrease in body weight, while the value for serum insulin showed a significant increase at 120 minutes. In group B, neither blood sugar nor serum insulin showed a significant change after a decrease in body weight. 2) After a decrease in body weight, group A showed a significant decrease in the glucose area, but no significant change in the insulin area. On the other hand, group B showed no significant change in either the glucose area or the insulin area after a decrease in body weight. 3) Group A showed a significant increase in insulinogenic index at each measurement after a decrease in body weight. Group B showed no significant change in insulinogenic index after a decrease in body weight. From the above results, it is considered that successful decrease in body weight of a diabetic due to diet regulation is accompanied by an increase in insulin secretion.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '非糖尿病肥満者', 'relation': 'ではブドウ糖負荷時に', 'object': '血中インスリンの過剰反応がみられ、体重の減少により正常化する'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 非糖尿病肥満者 (non-diabetic obese persons)
- **Relation:** ではブドウ糖負荷時に (upon glucose load)
- **Object:** 血中インスリンの過剰反応がみられ、体重の減少により正常化する (excessive insulin response is observed, and it normalizes with weight loss)

### English Abstract
Relevant sentence:
> "It is known that insulin response to the glucose load in non-diabetic obese persons becomes normal after a decrease in the body weight."

#### Reasoning
- The subject "non-diabetic obese persons" matches exactly.
- The context is "insulin response to the glucose load" — matches "ブドウ糖負荷時に血中インスリン".
- The claim is that the insulin response is abnormal (implied excessive) and becomes normal after weight loss — matches "過剰反応がみられ、体重の減少により正常化する".
- The English sentence does not explicitly say "excessive" but implies abnormality that normalizes after weight loss, which is a reasonable match to the Japanese triple.

### Score: **2 (Direct match)**
- The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly expressed in one sentence in the English abstract.

### Supporting Sentence
- "It is known that insulin response to the glucose load in non-diabetic obese persons becomes normal after a decrease in the body weight."

**Final Score:** 2  
**Supporting Sentence:** "It is known that insulin response to the glucose load in non-diabetic obese persons becomes normal after a decrease in the body weight."
