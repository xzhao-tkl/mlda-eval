English abstract: Background. Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (PEH) is a vascular tumor characterized by the growth of vascular endothelial cells. Because of its characteristic of low-to-intermediate grade malignancy, PEH usually grows very slowly and needs differential diagnoses from the various metastatic malignant tumors. The imaging findings are usually non-specific, and in many cases, preoperative diagnosis by bronchoscopy is difficult. We report a case of PEH diagnosed by thoracoscopic lung biopsy. Case. A 33-year-old woman underwent chest radiography screening, which showed multiple nodular shadows in both lungs. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple nodules in both lungs. We suspected tumor metastases, and performed systemic screening for possible primary tumors, but the results were negative. Therefore, we performed video-assisted thoracoscopic lung biopsy, and a pathological diagnosis of PEH was made. Conclusion. The preoperative diagnosis of PEH by imaging or bronchoscopy is usually difficult, and lung biopsy is essential. Moreover, the prognosis remains uncertain even in the absence of prognostic factors. There is no established treatment method for PEH and therefore, long-term follow-up needs to be conducted.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'PEHの診断', 'relation': 'に有用な方法は', 'object': '外科的肺生検'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** PEHの診断 (Diagnosis of PEH)
- **Relation:** に有用な方法は (Useful method for)
- **Object:** 外科的肺生検 (Surgical lung biopsy)

### English Abstract Analysis

We need to check if the English abstract supports the knowledge that "Surgical lung biopsy is a useful method for the diagnosis of PEH."

#### Relevant Sentences:
1. "We report a case of PEH diagnosed by thoracoscopic lung biopsy."
2. "The preoperative diagnosis of PEH by imaging or bronchoscopy is usually difficult, and lung biopsy is essential."

#### Reasoning:
- The abstract directly states that PEH was diagnosed by thoracoscopic lung biopsy (which is a type of surgical lung biopsy).
- It further emphasizes that imaging or bronchoscopy is usually difficult for preoperative diagnosis, and "lung biopsy is essential," which strongly supports the idea that surgical lung biopsy is a useful (and perhaps necessary) method for diagnosing PEH.

### Score: **2 (Direct match)**
- The triple is clearly and directly supported by the abstract, especially in the sentences above.

### Sentences Supporting the Triple:
1. "We report a case of PEH diagnosed by thoracoscopic lung biopsy."
2. "The preoperative diagnosis of PEH by imaging or bronchoscopy is usually difficult, and lung biopsy is essential."

### Final Evaluation:
**Score: 2 (Direct match)**  
**Supporting sentences:**  
- "We report a case of PEH diagnosed by thoracoscopic lung biopsy."  
- "The preoperative diagnosis of PEH by imaging or bronchoscopy is usually difficult, and lung biopsy is essential."
