English abstract: To assess the efficacy of percutaneous cardiopulmonary support system (PCPS), we studied 16 patients supported urgently by PCPS (11 males, 5 females, mean age: 61 years). The reasons for indicating PCPS were cardiogenic shock in 10 patients, cardiac rupture in 3 patients and ventricular fibrillation (Vf) in 3 patients. Fourteen patients (88%) had ischemic heart disease (IHD). The remaining 2 patients had dilated cadiomyopathy and valvular heart disease, respectively. In five patients (31%), PCPS was used in combination with intraaortic balloon pump support. Finally, 4 patients (25%) survived: 1 patient with Vf and 3 patients with IHD. All of these 3 patients with IHD succeeded in coronary revascularization under the support of PCPS. The remaining patient succeeded in the termination of Vf after operating PCPS. No patient studied in the present study had vascular injury. However, 2 patients had severe mediastinal bleeding due to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, one of whom died of hemorrhagic shock. In conclusion, early coronary revascularization following PCPS is important to recover from cardiogenic shock because cardioprotective effect of PCPS is poor. Anti-coagulation therapy in operating PCPS sometimes induces severe hemorrhagic complications, to which we should pay attention.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '虚血例でPCPSを開始した場合', 'relation': '必要とされるのは', 'object': '早期の血行再建'}

## Reasoning

**Japanese triple:**  
- Subject: 虚血例でPCPSを開始した場合 ("In cases of ischemia where PCPS is initiated")
- Relation: 必要とされるのは ("what is required/needed is")
- Object: 早期の血行再建 ("early coronary revascularization")

**English abstract analysis:**  
The abstract states:  
> "In conclusion, early coronary revascularization following PCPS is important to recover from cardiogenic shock because cardioprotective effect of PCPS is poor."

Also, it mentions:  
> "All of these 3 patients with IHD succeeded in coronary revascularization under the support of PCPS."

And:  
> "Fourteen patients (88%) had ischemic heart disease (IHD)."

The abstract clearly discusses that in ischemic cases (IHD), when PCPS is started, early coronary revascularization is important/necessary for recovery. This matches the Japanese triple.

## Score

**Score: 2 (Direct match)**  
- The knowledge triple is directly and clearly expressed in the abstract, especially in the conclusion sentence.

## Supporting sentences

1. "In conclusion, early coronary revascularization following PCPS is important to recover from cardiogenic shock because cardioprotective effect of PCPS is poor."
2. "All of these 3 patients with IHD succeeded in coronary revascularization under the support of PCPS."

## Summary

The Japanese triple is directly supported by the English abstract, with explicit statements about the necessity of early coronary revascularization when PCPS is initiated in ischemic cases.
