English abstract: A 44-year-old woman underwent left nephrectomy with resection of retroperitoneal tumor (leiomyosarcoma) on April, 1997. Subsequently, recurrence was diagnosed and she underwent partial hepatectomy of S2 and S4 on early in February, 2000, and lateral segmentectomy of the liver on middle of December, 2001. Both of the resected liver tumors were diagnosed as histologically metastases from leiomyosarcoma. On late in July, 2002 she was admitted with abdominal pain, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed tumor, 2cm in di- ameter, in the tail of the pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was carried out on late in August, 2002 and also histologically diagnosed as metastases to the pancreas. She has been alive 12 months postopera- tively without relapse. This case was very rare and we did find a few reports in which cases of resection of the pancreatic metastasis from soft-tissue sarcoma with or without other organ metastases could expect conse- quence in the long-term survival. Resection may one of treatments for cases like this diagnosed as pancreatic metastasis.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '転移性膵腫瘍', 'relation': 'の治療法の1選択肢として考慮すべきなのは', 'object': '外科的切除'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 転移性膵腫瘍 (metastatic pancreatic tumor)
- **Relation:** の治療法の1選択肢として考慮すべきなのは (should be considered as one treatment option)
- **Object:** 外科的切除 (surgical resection)

### English Abstract Analysis

The relevant part of the abstract is:
> "This case was very rare and we did find a few reports in which cases of resection of the pancreatic metastasis from soft-tissue sarcoma with or without other organ metastases could expect consequence in the long-term survival. Resection may one of treatments for cases like this diagnosed as pancreatic metastasis."

#### Reasoning

- The abstract discusses a case of metastatic pancreatic tumor (from leiomyosarcoma).
- It mentions that surgical resection ("resection") was performed and that "resection may [be] one of treatments for cases like this diagnosed as pancreatic metastasis."
- This directly matches the Japanese triple, which states that "surgical resection should be considered as one treatment option for metastatic pancreatic tumor."

#### Sentence(s) Supporting the Triple

- "Resection may one of treatments for cases like this diagnosed as pancreatic metastasis."

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

- The knowledge triple is clearly and directly expressed in the abstract.

**Summary:**  
The English abstract directly supports the Japanese triple. The statement "Resection may one of treatments for cases like this diagnosed as pancreatic metastasis" matches the triple's meaning that surgical resection should be considered as a treatment option for metastatic pancreatic tumor.
