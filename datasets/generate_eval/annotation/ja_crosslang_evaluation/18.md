English abstract: High dose rate intraluminal radiation therapy (ILRT) for esophageal carcinoma was started at our hospital in 1982. The standard treatment was 10 to l2Gy of ILRT following 50 to 60Gy of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). The dose of ILRT was prescribed at a level 5mm below the surface of mucosa. The thickness of residual tumor after EBRT, however, differed in each case. From August 1991 through April 1994, the residual tumor thickness after EBRT was measured in 17 patients by endoscopic ultrasonography. Minimum tumor dose was calculated by computer. Minimum tumor dose of ILRT correlated with the thickness of the tumor. The local control rate was significantly higher in patients treated with more than 9Gy of minimum tumor dose than in the less than 9Gy group. All of the more than 9Gy group were recognized as T 1 or 2 (UICC, 1987). Furthermore, analysis of the relationship between balloon diameter and minimum tumor dose disclosed that minimum tumor dose of more than 9Gy could be administered in patients where the maximum tumor thickness was less than 8 to 9mm. Consequently, ILRT is only effective for early stage esophageal carcinoma. Accordingly, endscopic ultrasonography has proved to be a very useful tool to identify patients with a high risk of local failure before ILRT.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '腫瘍最小線量', 'relation': 'は相関している', 'object': '腫瘍壁厚'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

**Japanese triple:**  
- Subject: 腫瘍最小線量 (Minimum tumor dose)  
- Relation: は相関している (is correlated with)  
- Object: 腫瘍壁厚 (tumor wall thickness)

**English abstract:**  
> "Minimum tumor dose of ILRT correlated with the thickness of the tumor."

### Reasoning

- The triple states that "minimum tumor dose is correlated with tumor wall thickness."
- The English abstract contains the sentence:  
  > "Minimum tumor dose of ILRT correlated with the thickness of the tumor."
- This is a direct match to the Japanese triple, as it explicitly states the correlation between minimum tumor dose and tumor thickness.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**  
- The knowledge is clearly expressed in one sentence in the abstract.

### Supporting Sentence

- "Minimum tumor dose of ILRT correlated with the thickness of the tumor."

**Final Evaluation:**  
Score: **2**  
Supporting sentence: "Minimum tumor dose of ILRT correlated with the thickness of the tumor."
