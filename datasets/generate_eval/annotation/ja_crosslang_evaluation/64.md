English abstract: Leukostasis is a severe complication of hyperleukocytosis secondary to childhood leukemia. Although increased leukocyte counts tend to induce the occurrence of leukostasis, additional factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of leukostasis, such as the size and deformability of blast cells, and the expression levels of adhesion molecules. Such factors might explain why the incidence of leukostasis differs among acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia. Leukostasis is associated with an increased risk of early death, and is considered to involve blast cell aggregates and thrombi in the circulation, inducing tissue hypoxia. The central nervous system and lungs are the most common sites for leukostasis. Although the pathological definition of leukostasis is clear, its clinical diagnosis is rarely made with high confidence. Because leukostasis is an oncological emergency, leukapheresis may prove beneficial in cases manifesting severe leukostatic symptoms, and immediate initiation of chemotherapy for this chemosensitive disease should not be delayed.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '白血球数増多', 'relation': 'は発症を増やす', 'object': 'leukostasis'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 白血球数増多 (increased leukocyte count / hyperleukocytosis)
- Relation: は発症を増やす (increases the incidence / induces the occurrence)
- Object: leukostasis

### English Abstract Analysis
The relevant sentence in the English abstract is:
> "Although increased leukocyte counts tend to induce the occurrence of leukostasis, additional factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of leukostasis, such as the size and deformability of blast cells, and the expression levels of adhesion molecules."

This sentence directly states that increased leukocyte counts (hyperleukocytosis) tend to induce the occurrence of leukostasis.

### Reasoning
- The Japanese triple claims that increased leukocyte count increases the incidence of leukostasis.
- The English abstract explicitly states that increased leukocyte counts tend to induce the occurrence of leukostasis.
- The relationship is directly expressed in one sentence.

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence
- "Although increased leukocyte counts tend to induce the occurrence of leukostasis, additional factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of leukostasis, such as the size and deformability of blast cells, and the expression levels of adhesion molecules."

**Conclusion:**  
The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract.
