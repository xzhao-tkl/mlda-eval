English abstract: Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is an important postoperative complication of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA). Open abdominal management (OAM) has been reported to be effective in EVAR ; however, only a limited number of reports are available on when and how to close the abdomen. Here we report a case of early abdominal wall closure achieved through the combined use of retroperitoneal hematoma evacuation after EVAR and OAM for rAAA. The patient was a 79-year-old woman who underwent EVAR for rAAA on an emergency basis. She developed ACS after EVAR and underwent OAM. Four days after surgery, a decrease in intraabdominal pressure was confirmed, and subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed the absence of an endoleak ; retroperitoneal hematoma evacuation was performed, during which the abdominal wall was closed. The postoperative course was good, and the patient was discharged. Early closure of the abdomen may be possible by concomitant retroperitoneal hematoma evacuation after EVAR and OAM for rAAA.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '破裂性腹部大動脈瘤(rAAA)に対する腹部大動脈ステントグラフト内挿術(EVAR)術後', 'relation': 'の重要な合併症の1つは', 'object': '腹部コンパートメント症候群（ACS）'}

**Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation**

**Japanese Triple:**  
- Subject: 破裂性腹部大動脈瘤(rAAA)に対する腹部大動脈ステントグラフト内挿術(EVAR)術後 (Postoperative period after EVAR for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA))
- Relation: の重要な合併症の1つは (one of the important complications is)
- Object: 腹部コンパートメント症候群（ACS） (abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS))

**English Abstract:**  
"Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is an important postoperative complication of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAA)."

**Reasoning:**  
The English abstract directly states:
