English abstract: We conducted laparoscopic partial excision of the cecum to treat mucinous cystadenoma of the appendix in a 67-years old woman admitted to our hospital due to submucosal tumor in the cecum on colonoscopy. Barium enema and abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed mucocele in the appendix and laparoscopic partial excision was conducted. Ileocecal stenosis occurred temporarily postoperatively, but no serious sequel was observed. Postoperative pathologic examination showed that the mucocele was benign mucinous cystadenoma. Even though the mucocele did not appear malignant histologically, it could induce pseudomyxoma peritonei, so surgery is often chosen with appendectomy, ileocecal resection, or right hemicolectomy done after abdominal section. Although laparoscopy has recently been applied to mucocele treatment, little attempt has been made to apply laparoscopic partial excision of cecum according to our search of a computer-assisted database. As indicated here, laparoscopic partial excision of cecum for a mucocele is beneficial in diagnosis and is safe and less invasive than conventional operation.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '虫垂切除や回盲部切除', 'relation': 'は多くの場合', 'object': '開腹下で行われている'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 虫垂切除や回盲部切除 (appendectomy or ileocecal resection)
- Relation: は多くの場合 (in many cases)
- Object: 開腹下で行われている (are performed via open abdominal surgery)

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant sentences:
> "Even though the mucocele did not appear malignant histologically, it could induce pseudomyxoma peritonei, so surgery is often chosen with appendectomy, ileocecal resection, or right hemicolectomy done after abdominal section."

This sentence states that appendectomy, ileocecal resection, or right hemicolectomy are "done after abdominal section," which means they are typically performed via open abdominal surgery. The phrase "surgery is often chosen" and the listing of these procedures in the context of "abdominal section" directly supports the Japanese triple.

### Reasoning

- The English abstract directly mentions that appendectomy and ileocecal resection are often performed after abdominal section (i.e., open surgery).
- This matches the Japanese triple, which states that these procedures are, in many cases, performed via open abdominal surgery.
- The knowledge is expressed in one sentence in the abstract.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match — same triple is clearly expressed in one sentence in the abstract.**

### Supporting Sentence
