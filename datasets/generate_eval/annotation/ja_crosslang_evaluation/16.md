English abstract: We describe considerations for carrying out ultrasound examinations in cases of common urologic emergency diseases. Urologic diseases requiring emergency surgery or treatment are limited and infrequent and comprise such conditions as trauma of the urogenital organ, rupture of a renal neoplastic mass, rupture of a renal aneurysm, renal infarction, and testicular torsion. On the other hand, those requiring palliative surgery or treatment include stones in the upper urinary tract, acute pyelonephritis, acute renal failure, acute orchitis and epididymitis, bladder tamponade, renal arteriovenous fistula, and urinary retention. When US examination is performed by a US technician or physician, the specific characteristics of pathogenesis and the ultrasonographic features of these emergency diseases should be understood. Moreover, differential diagnosis to distinguish gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and gynecologic emergency diseases from urologic diseases is also important.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '泌尿器科領域において緊急手術や処置が必要な疾患', 'relation': 'には', 'object': '外傷（腎・膀胱・精巣）、腎腫瘍破裂（腎癌・腎血管筋脂肪腫）、腎動脈瘤破裂、腎梗塞、精巣軸捻転が含まれる'}

**Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation**

**Japanese Triple:**
- Subject: 泌尿器科領域において緊急手術や処置が必要な疾患 (Urologic diseases requiring emergency surgery or treatment)
- Relation: には (include)
- Object: 外傷（腎・膀胱・精巣）、腎腫瘍破裂（腎癌・腎血管筋脂肪腫）、腎動脈瘤破裂、腎梗塞、精巣軸捻転 (trauma of the urogenital organ, rupture of a renal neoplastic mass, rupture of a renal aneurysm, renal infarction, and testicular torsion)

**English Abstract:**
> Urologic diseases requiring emergency surgery or treatment are limited and infrequent and comprise such conditions as trauma of the urogenital organ, rupture of a renal neoplastic mass, rupture of a renal aneurysm, renal infarction, and testicular torsion.

**Reasoning:**
- The English abstract directly states that "Urologic diseases requiring emergency surgery or treatment ... comprise such conditions as trauma of the urogenital organ, rupture of a renal neoplastic mass, rupture of a renal aneurysm, renal infarction, and testicular torsion."
- This matches the Japanese triple exactly: the subject, relation, and object are all present in one sentence.
- The specific diseases listed in the Japanese triple are all mentioned in the English abstract.

**Score:** 2 (Direct match)

**Sentence(s) supporting the triple:**
> "Urologic diseases requiring emergency surgery or treatment are limited and infrequent and comprise such conditions as trauma of the urogenital organ, rupture of a renal neoplastic mass, rupture of a renal aneurysm, renal infarction, and testicular torsion."

**Conclusion:**  
The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract, with all elements present in a single sentence.
