English abstract: To examine the serological and histological reactions of mice toEscherichia coli, germfree mice at the age of 4 weeks were given perorally a strain of E. coli.In the feces and gastrointestinal contents of these monocontaminated animals of the first generation of gnotobiotic life (gnotobiotic mice I) and their offsprings (gnotobiotic mice II), a large number of organisms were detected, as shown in Fig. 1. The organisms were also recovered from the cranial mesenteric lymph nodes, the liver and the lungs of the two groups of gnotobiotic mice. Serum antibody titers to theE. coliorganisms examined by indirect hemagglutination methods were shown in Table 1. An elevation in agglutinin titers toE. coliwas observed with all of the gnotobiotic mice I, while the antibody was detectable at a low titer in only a half of gnotobiotic mice II. No detectable antibodies to theE. coliorganisms were present in the majority of our germfree and conventional mice. Some immature secondary nodules and some plasma cells in the medullary cords existed in the cortex of lymph nodes of the gnotobiotic mice I and II, while few of them were detected in germfree mice.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '無菌マウスのリンパ組織', 'relation': 'においては', 'object': '二次小節の形成や形質細胞の出現がほとんど認められない'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 無菌マウスのリンパ組織 (Lymphatic tissue of germfree mice)
- **Relation:** においては (in/with respect to)
- **Object:** 二次小節の形成や形質細胞の出現がほとんど認められない (Formation of secondary nodules and appearance of plasma cells are hardly observed)

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant sentences:
> Some immature secondary nodules and some plasma cells in the medullary cords existed in the cortex of lymph nodes of the gnotobiotic mice I and II, while few of them were detected in germfree mice.

This sentence directly compares the lymphatic tissue of gnotobiotic mice (exposed to E. coli) and germfree mice. It states that "few of them were detected in germfree mice," referring to secondary nodules and plasma cells.

### Reasoning

- The Japanese triple claims that in the lymphatic tissue of germfree mice, the formation of secondary nodules and appearance of plasma cells are hardly observed.
- The English abstract supports this by stating that "few of them were detected in germfree mice," directly referring to secondary nodules and plasma cells.
- This is a direct match: the same knowledge is clearly expressed in one sentence.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence

> "Some immature secondary nodules and some plasma cells in the medullary cords existed in the cortex of lymph nodes of the gnotobiotic mice I and II, while few of them were detected in germfree mice."

---

**Summary:**  
The Japanese triple is directly supported by the English abstract, specifically in the sentence comparing the presence of secondary nodules and plasma cells in gnotobiotic and germfree mice.
