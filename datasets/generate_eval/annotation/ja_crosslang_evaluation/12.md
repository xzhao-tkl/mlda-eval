English abstract: We herein report the case of a 55-year-old woman with polysplenia and a short pancreas. She had received pacemaker therapy for sick sinus syndrome at 35 years of age and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at 44 years of age. Therapy with medical nutrition and the administration of oral agents allowed her to achieve adequate glycemic control initially; however, her glycemic control gradually became unsatisfactory. In February 2012, she was admitted to our hospital due to epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting. A gastrointestinal X-ray showed intestinal obstruction, while a computed tomography scan disclosed polysplenia, interruption of the vena cava with azygos continuation, a right bilobed lung, the absence of the body or tail of the pancreas and a pancreatic volume that was approximately 50 %of normal. Therefore, a deficiency in insulin secretion resulting from agenesis of the dorsal pancreas was the leading cause of the patient's diabetes. Near normal glycemic control was achieved with multiple daily insulin injections. Polysplenia syndrome is a rare congenital disorder associated with cardiac and visceral anomalies. Only 5-10 %of polysplenia patients without cardiac involvement reach adulthood. The present patient was diagnosed with polysplenia after a 10-year history of diabetes. We suggest that more studies, including imaging examinations, are needed in cases of diabetes.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '多脾症', 'relation': 'は合併することが多い', 'object': '先天性心疾患や内臓奇形'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 多脾症 (Polysplenia)
- Relation: は合併することが多い (is often associated with / frequently co-occurs with)
- Object: 先天性心疾患や内臓奇形 (congenital heart disease and visceral anomalies)

### English Abstract
Relevant sentence:
> "Polysplenia syndrome is a rare congenital disorder associated with cardiac and visceral anomalies."

### Reasoning
The Japanese triple states that polysplenia is often associated with congenital heart disease and visceral anomalies. The English abstract directly says that "Polysplenia syndrome is a rare congenital disorder associated with cardiac and visceral anomalies." This is a direct match: the subject (polysplenia), relation (associated with), and object (cardiac and visceral anomalies) are all present in one sentence.

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence
- "Polysplenia syndrome is a rare congenital disorder associated with cardiac and visceral anomalies."

### Conclusion
The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract.
