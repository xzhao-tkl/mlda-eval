English abstract: Photo-oxidation of anthracene on activated alumina was studied. The oxidizing activity of alumina produced by calcination of aluminum hydroxide varied with its calcinating temperature in such a way that two maximal activities were obtained: the maximal activities were obtained when alumina was calcinated at 300-350° C and at 620° C. The oxidizing activity of alumina was also proportional to the acidity of its Lewis acid site. The reactivity of anthracene on alumina was little affected by the wavelength of the light illuminated. Identification of the reaction products and measurements of the diffuse reflection spectrum of anthracene during the reaction revealed that (1) a primary product of the reaction was 9, 10-epidioxYanthracene which was appreciably stable on the surface of alumina, (2) this product was converted into cis-9, 10-dihydroxyanthracene and anthraquinone, and (3) the former was oxidized to anthraquinone and the latter was oxidized to mono-hydroxyanthraquinone or alizarin. From the above results, it was suggested that the reaction proceeds through a chargetransfer complex between anthracene and alumina.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'アルミナとアントラセンとの電荷移動錯体', 'relation': 'が光励起されることで', 'object': '反応が進行すると考えられた'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** アルミナとアントラセンとの電荷移動錯体 (charge-transfer complex between alumina and anthracene)
- **Relation:** が光励起されることで (by being photoexcited)
- **Object:** 反応が進行すると考えられた (it was suggested that the reaction proceeds)

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant sentence:
> From the above results, it was suggested that the reaction proceeds through a charge-transfer complex between anthracene and alumina.

#### Reasoning

- The English abstract directly states that the reaction proceeds through a charge-transfer complex between anthracene and alumina.
- The Japanese triple adds the detail "by being photoexcited" (光励起されることで), which is not explicitly stated in the English abstract. However, the context of the study is "Photo-oxidation of anthracene on activated alumina," which implies that the reaction is driven by light (photoexcitation).
- The abstract does not explicitly say "the charge-transfer complex is photoexcited," but since the whole study is about photo-oxidation, it is reasonable to infer that the charge-transfer complex is involved in the photo-induced reaction process.

### Score: **1 (Inferable)**

- The triple is not expressed in a single sentence, but it can be reasonably inferred from the abstract as a whole, given the context of photo-oxidation and the mention of the charge-transfer complex as the reaction pathway.

### Supporting Sentence(s)

- "Photo-oxidation of anthracene on activated alumina was studied."
- "From the above results, it was suggested that the reaction proceeds through a charge-transfer complex between anthracene and alumina."

### Summary

- **Score:** 1 (Inferable)
- **Reasoning:** The abstract does not explicitly state that the charge-transfer complex is photoexcited, but the context of photo-oxidation and the mention of the complex as the reaction pathway make it a reasonable inference.
- **Supporting sentences:** See above.
