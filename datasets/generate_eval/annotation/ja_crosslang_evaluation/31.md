English abstract: It is difficult to apply skin grafts to hypovascular tissue, such as that found on the skull. Exposing the bone marrow is a commonly used technique during the application of skin grafts to the skull. However, during extensive surgery for skull-exposing wounds removing the calvarial bone can increase blood loss and even weaken the skull.  We compared the skin graft methods employed in 3 patients who were left with wide skull-exposing wounds after tumor excision. In case 1, we removed the whole calvarial bone, and performed a skin graft operation directly on the bone marrow. In case 2, we partially removed the calvarial bone and covered the whole wound with artificial dermis. At 28 days after the first operation, we performed a skin graft operation. In case 3, we drilled the calvarial bone in a reticular pattern and covered the whole wound with artificial dermis. At 21 days after the first operation, we performed a skin graft operation. In these 3 cases, we found that retaining the calvarial bone had certain advantages. In addition to increasing the strength of the bone, the skin grafts placed on calvarial bone were more stable than the skin graft that was placed directly on the bone marrow. Therefore, we consider that as much as possible of the calvarial bone should be kept intact when reconstructing full-thickness scalp defects.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '広範囲の頭蓋骨露出創において外板をすべて除去すること', 'relation': 'によって生じる可能性がある', 'object': '術中出血量の増加と頭蓋骨の強度の低下'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 広範囲の頭蓋骨露出創において外板をすべて除去すること (Removing the entire outer table of the calvarial bone in wide skull-exposing wounds)
- **Relation:** によって生じる可能性がある (can cause / may result in)
- **Object:** 術中出血量の増加と頭蓋骨の強度の低下 (increased intraoperative blood loss and decreased skull strength)

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant sentences:
> "However, during extensive surgery for skull-exposing wounds removing the calvarial bone can increase blood loss and even weaken the skull."

This sentence directly states that removing the calvarial bone (outer table) during surgery for wide skull-exposing wounds can increase blood loss and weaken the skull, which matches the Japanese triple.

### Reasoning

- The subject in the Japanese triple ("removing the entire outer table of the calvarial bone in wide skull-exposing wounds") is directly referenced in the English abstract as "removing the calvarial bone" during "extensive surgery for skull-exposing wounds."
- The relation ("can cause") is expressed in the English abstract as "can increase" and "even weaken."
- The object ("increased intraoperative blood loss and decreased skull strength") is directly matched by "increase blood loss and even weaken the skull."

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence(s)

- "However, during extensive surgery for skull-exposing wounds removing the calvarial bone can increase blood loss and even weaken the skull."

### Summary

The knowledge triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract, with all elements of the triple present in a single sentence.
