English abstract: Megacolon is a disorder with clinical manifestations of abdominal distention and chronic constipation due to sustained enlargement of the colon. Recently we have experienced a case of megacolon with episodes of sigmoid volvulus performed total colectomy. An 81-year-old woman was seen at the department of internal medicine in our hospital because of abdominal distention, nausea and vomiting, and was admitted with a diagnosis of ileus on October 2. 2001. Since megacolon especially enlargement of the sigmoid colon had been identified on the previous barium enema study, sigmoid volvulus was most likely and reduction with colonofiberscopy was carried out. However, the patient developed ileus repeatedly thereafter and was referred to the department of surgery. Preoperative abdominal CT and magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed tumors at the upper pole of the left kidney and on the left chest wall. On November 13, total colectomy and removals of the tumors at the upper pole of the left kidney and on the left chest wall were performed. Histopathological study showed that the colonic nerve plexus was kept intact, and spontaneous megacolon was definitely diagnosed. And the removed tumors were diagnosed as malignant fibrous histiocytoma.
