English abstract: A 50-year-old woman undergoing hemodialysis presented sudden onset of dyspnea and was diagnosed as having pulmonary edema related to acute heart failure. After admission, she lost weight and began antihypertensive drug treatment. Four days after discharge, she experienced respiratory distress and returned to our hospital. On arrival, she presented respiratory failure and severe hypertension. Plain chest radiographs showed marked pulmonary edema, but echocardiographic findings did not show fluid retention. Our diagnosis was acute heart failure driven by shifting of body fluids to the heart and lungs due to blood vessel contraction (vascular failure). She received supplemental oxygen and nitroglycerin as primary treatment, and her respiratory status rapidly improved. After admission, acute heart failure recurred. After beginning to take alpha-1 blockers in addition to beta blockers, acute heart failure did not recur. In cases of acute cardiac failure due to vascular failure, even in HD patients, primary treatment with vasodilators is useful. Vascular failure was caused by hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. Hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system was widely reported in HD patients. Noting acute heart failure due to hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system could improve the prognosis of dialysis patients.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'Vascular failureによる急性心不全のHD患者', 'relation': 'において初期治療として有用なのは', 'object': '血管拡張薬'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** Vascular failureによる急性心不全のHD患者 (HD patients with acute heart failure due to vascular failure)
- **Relation:** において初期治療として有用なのは (as initial treatment, what is useful)
- **Object:** 血管拡張薬 (vasodilators)

### English Abstract Analysis

We need to check if the abstract supports the knowledge that "vasodilators are useful as initial treatment in HD patients with acute heart failure due to vascular failure."

#### Relevant Sentences:
1. "Our diagnosis was acute heart failure driven by shifting of body fluids to the heart and lungs due to blood vessel contraction (vascular failure)."
2. "She received supplemental oxygen and nitroglycerin as primary treatment, and her respiratory status rapidly improved."
3. "In cases of acute cardiac failure due to vascular failure, even in HD patients, primary treatment with vasodilators is useful."

#### Reasoning

- Sentence 1 establishes the context: the patient is an HD patient with acute heart failure due to vascular failure.
- Sentence 2 describes the initial treatment: nitroglycerin (a vasodilator) was used as primary treatment.
- Sentence 3 generalizes the finding: "In cases of acute cardiac failure due to vascular failure, even in HD patients, primary treatment with vasodilators is useful." This is a direct statement matching the Japanese triple.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

- The abstract clearly and directly states that vasodilators are useful as initial treatment in HD patients with acute heart failure due to vascular failure.

### Supporting Sentences

- "In cases of acute cardiac failure due to vascular failure, even in HD patients, primary treatment with vasodilators is useful."
- "She received supplemental oxygen and nitroglycerin as primary treatment, and her respiratory status rapidly improved."

### Final Evaluation

**Score: 2**

**Reasoning:** The English abstract directly expresses the same knowledge as the Japanese triple, both in a general statement and in the specific case described. The relevant sentences are quoted above.
