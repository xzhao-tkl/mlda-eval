English abstract: Background: It is important to differentiate pilocytic astrocytoma, which is Grade I in the WHO classification, from Grade II astrocytoma. We report a case of pilocytic astrocytoma in which intraoperative rapid diagnosis by crush preparation cytology was useful. Case: The patient was a 12-year-old male in whom a cystic cerebellar tumor was discovered as an incidental finding on a CT image. Based on his age, the location of the cystic mass, progress, and the MRI findings, a preoperstive diagnosis of astrocytoma was made, and tumorectomy was carried out. Intraoperative rapid diagnosis by crush preparation cytology was performed. The nuclei of the tumor cells ranged from elliptic to spindleshaped. The cytoplasm of the tumor cells contained long glial fibers, thick sausage-like glial fibers that were indistinct in the HE-stained frozen specimen readily stained with orange G and were clearly observed in the vicinity. The thick sausage-like fibers appeared to be Rosenthal fibers, and we made a final diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma. Conclusion: Crush preparation cytology specimens are effective for detecting the Rosenthal fibers of pilocytic astrocytoma by rapid diagnosis. Such specimens enable differentiation between pilocytic astrocytoma and Grade II astrocytoma.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '毛様細胞性星細胞腫', 'relation': 'は', 'object': 'WHO分類Grade Iの星細胞腫であり、Grade II星細胞腫との鑑別が治療上重要である'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 毛様細胞性星細胞腫 (Pilocytic astrocytoma)
- Relation: は (is)
- Object: WHO分類Grade Iの星細胞腫であり、Grade II星細胞腫との鑑別が治療上重要である (is a Grade I astrocytoma in the WHO classification, and differentiation from Grade II astrocytoma is important for treatment)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Relevant Sentences:
1. "It is important to differentiate pilocytic astrocytoma, which is Grade I in the WHO classification, from Grade II astrocytoma."
2. "Such specimens enable differentiation between pilocytic astrocytoma and Grade II astrocytoma."

#### Reasoning:
- The first sentence directly states that pilocytic astrocytoma is Grade I in the WHO classification and that differentiation from Grade II astrocytoma is important.
- This matches the Japanese triple both in content (classification and importance of differentiation) and in structure (subject, relation, object).

### Score: **2 (Direct match)**

#### Supporting Sentences:
- "It is important to differentiate pilocytic astrocytoma, which is Grade I in the WHO classification, from Grade II astrocytoma."

### Conclusion:
The knowledge triple is directly and clearly expressed in the English abstract. The same information is found in one sentence, so the score is **2**.
