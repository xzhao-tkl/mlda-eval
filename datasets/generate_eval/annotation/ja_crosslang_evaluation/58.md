English abstract: Alkali therapy is widely accepted as a treatment for recurrent calcium stone patients with distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA). Nine patients, five with complete and four with incomplete type of dRTA, were treated with alkali agents for more than three years; an average period of 10.8 years. In five patients, new stone formation and stone growth were completely prevented by this treatment. Among the four failed cases, three did not take enough alkali agents (in spite of our medication), and the other had recurrent urinary tract infection resulting in infectious stone formation. In conclusion, the long-term efficacy of alkali therapy for prevention of recurrent stone formation with dRTA is confirmed when the patient takes enough alkali agents and the urinary tract infection is well controlled.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'dRTAに対するアルカリ剤の投与', 'relation': 'は有効である', 'object': '既存尿路結石の増大予防および新たな結石形成の長期予防'}

## Reasoning

**Japanese triple:**  
- Subject: dRTAに対するアルカリ剤の投与 (Administration of alkali agents for dRTA)
- Relation: は有効である (is effective)
- Object: 既存尿路結石の増大予防および新たな結石形成の長期予防 (for long-term prevention of growth of existing urinary stones and formation of new stones)

**English abstract:**  
- Alkali therapy is widely accepted as a treatment for recurrent calcium stone patients with distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA).
- Nine patients (with dRTA) were treated with alkali agents for more than three years (average 10.8 years).
- In five patients, new stone formation and stone growth were completely prevented by this treatment.
- The conclusion: long-term efficacy of alkali therapy for prevention of recurrent stone formation with dRTA is confirmed when the patient takes enough alkali agents and urinary tract infection is well controlled.

**Evaluation:**  
- The abstract directly states that alkali therapy (alkali agents) for dRTA patients prevented both new stone formation and stone growth in five patients, and the conclusion confirms the long-term efficacy for prevention of recurrent stone formation.
- The Japanese triple claims that administration of alkali agents for dRTA is effective for long-term prevention of growth of existing urinary stones and formation of new stones.
- The knowledge in the triple is directly supported by the abstract, especially in the sentences:  
  - "In five patients, new stone formation and stone growth were completely prevented by this treatment."
  - "In conclusion, the long-term efficacy of alkali therapy for prevention of recurrent stone formation with dRTA is confirmed when the patient takes enough alkali agents and the urinary tract infection is well controlled."
