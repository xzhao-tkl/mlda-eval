English abstract: We applied 3D MR cisternogram/angiogram fusion imaging to 9 cases of the idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia for the preoperative assessment of the offending vessels for microvascular decompression (MVD). Fusion images of the 3D MR cisternogram/angiogram were reconstructed by a perspective volume-rendering algorithm from the volumetric data set of MR cisternography (black blood image), obtained by a T2-weighted 3D fast spin-echo sequence, and composed with the co-registered MR angiography (bright blood image), obtained by a 3D time-of-flight sequence with and without contrast medium. The complex anatomical relationship of the offending vessels, including superior cerebellar artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, posterior inferior cerebellar artery, vertebral artery and superior petrosal vein, to the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve was preoperatively assessed on the fusion images from various viewpoints in the cerebellopontine angle cistern and through the simulated surgical approach. The 3D visualization of the nerve-vessel relationship with fusion images was comparative to the intraoperative findings. Fusion imaging of 3D MR cisternogram/angiogram may prove useful in preoperative assessment of MVD for the idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'Fusion image', 'relation': 'では描出・評価可能である', 'object': '三叉神経REZでの責任血管による三叉神経の圧迫状況および術野に相応した神経-血管の立体的構築'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** Fusion image
- **Relation:** can depict/evaluate
- **Object:** The compression status of the trigeminal nerve by offending vessels at the trigeminal nerve REZ (root entry zone) and the three-dimensional nerve-vessel configuration corresponding to the surgical field.

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Key Sentences Related to the Triple

1. **"The complex anatomical relationship of the offending vessels, including superior cerebellar artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, posterior inferior cerebellar artery, vertebral artery and superior petrosal vein, to the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve was preoperatively assessed on the fusion images from various viewpoints in the cerebellopontine angle cistern and through the simulated surgical approach."**
   - This sentence directly states that the fusion images were used to assess the anatomical relationship (i.e., the three-dimensional configuration) of the offending vessels to the trigeminal nerve at the root entry zone (REZ), which matches the object in the Japanese triple.

2. **"The 3D visualization of the nerve-vessel relationship with fusion images was comparative to the intraoperative findings."**
   - This supports that the fusion images can depict the nerve-vessel relationship, including compression status, as seen during surgery.

3. **"Fusion imaging of 3D MR cisternogram/angiogram may prove useful in preoperative assessment of MVD for the idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia."**
   - This sentence summarizes the utility of fusion imaging for preoperative evaluation, which includes the assessment of the nerve-vessel relationship and compression.

#### Reasoning

- The abstract clearly states that fusion images are used to assess the anatomical relationship between the trigeminal nerve and offending vessels at the REZ, including their three-dimensional configuration as relevant to the surgical field.
- The depiction and evaluation of the compression status (nerve-vessel relationship) is directly mentioned as being visualized and compared to intraoperative findings.
- The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly and explicitly supported by the English abstract.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match — same triple is clearly expressed in one sentence in the abstract.**

### Supporting Sentences

- "The complex anatomical relationship of the offending vessels... to the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve was preoperatively assessed on the fusion images from various viewpoints in the cerebellopontine angle cistern and through the simulated surgical approach."
- "The 3D visualization of the nerve-vessel relationship with fusion images was comparative to the intraoperative findings."

### Conclusion

The Japanese triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract, with explicit mention of fusion images being used to depict and evaluate the three-dimensional nerve-vessel relationship and compression status at the trigeminal nerve REZ, corresponding to the surgical field.
