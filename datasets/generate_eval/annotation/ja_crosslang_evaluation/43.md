English abstract: Theoretical analysis of a membrane reactor was performed for a first-order reversible reaction by use of kinetic equations including both reaction-rate and separation-rate terms. Several fundamental conclusions were drawn with respect to a membrane reactor from the standpoint of chemical reaction engineering. It was found that there was an ideal maximum value for the overall conversion of a membrane reactor. The relation between ideal maximum conversion, membrane selectivity and equilibrium constant was obtained. Design conditions and operation conditions under which a membrane reactor is effective were examined.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '膜反応器の転化率', 'relation': 'には上限値が存在する', 'object': '理想最大転化率'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 膜反応器の転化率 (Conversion rate of a membrane reactor)
- Relation: には上限値が存在する (There is an upper limit)
- Object: 理想最大転化率 (Ideal maximum conversion rate)

### English Abstract Analysis
Relevant sentence:
> It was found that there was an ideal maximum value for the overall conversion of a membrane reactor.

This sentence directly states that for a membrane reactor, there is an ideal maximum value for the overall conversion, which matches the Japanese triple: the conversion rate of a membrane reactor has an upper limit, specifically the ideal maximum conversion rate.

### Reasoning
- The subject "膜反応器の転化率" (conversion rate of a membrane reactor) matches "overall conversion of a membrane reactor".
- The relation "には上限値が存在する" (there is an upper limit) matches "there was an ideal maximum value".
- The object "理想最大転化率" (ideal maximum conversion rate) matches "ideal maximum value for the overall conversion".

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence
> "It was found that there was an ideal maximum value for the overall conversion of a membrane reactor."

This sentence directly expresses the knowledge in the Japanese triple.
