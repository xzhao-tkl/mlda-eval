English abstract: Prosthetic grafts were modified by depositing on their surfaces with collagen or collagen-chondroitin sulfate complex by using glow discharge techniques and the veins of dogs were replaced with them. Biocompatibility and antithromobogenecity of the grafts were found to be enhanced by this treatment, especially with collagen-chondroitin sulfate complex. Fibrin formation and platelet adhesion on the grafts were inhibited and the patency extended for eleven months after replacement.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '人工血管表面', 'relation': 'で抑制されるのは', 'object': 'フィブリン形成と血小板の粘着'}

## Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 人工血管表面 (surface of prosthetic grafts)
- Relation: で抑制されるのは (what is inhibited/suppressed on)
- Object: フィブリン形成と血小板の粘着 (fibrin formation and platelet adhesion)

### English Abstract
Relevant sentence:
> "Fibrin formation and platelet adhesion on the grafts were inhibited and the patency extended for eleven months after replacement."

### Reasoning
The English abstract directly states that "Fibrin formation and platelet adhesion on the grafts were inhibited," which matches the Japanese triple: the surface of the prosthetic grafts (人工血管表面) is where fibrin formation and platelet adhesion (フィブリン形成と血小板の粘着) are inhibited (抑制される).

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence(s)
- "Fibrin formation and platelet adhesion on the grafts were inhibited and the patency extended for eleven months after replacement."

### Summary
The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly and clearly expressed in the English abstract. The inhibition of fibrin formation and platelet adhesion on the surface of prosthetic grafts is explicitly stated.
