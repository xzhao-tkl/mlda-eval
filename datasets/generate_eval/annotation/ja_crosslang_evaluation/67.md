English abstract: We report a case of acyclovir encephalopathy in a 77-year-old man who was introduced to peritoneal dialysis three years earlier. He developed herpes zoster and was treated with acyclovir (ACV) at 800 mg daily per oral. Two days later, he developed consciousness disturbance, hallucinations and asterixis. Acyclovir was stopped and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was switched to hemodialysis, which resulted in the resolution of his symptoms. Because the optimal dose of ACV varies among individuals depending on the bioavailability of ACV and metabolic enzyme activity, ACV encephalopathy can occur even when the acyclovir dose is modified according to the renal function of the affected patient. Because CAPD provides a poorer ACV clearance than hemodialysis, CAPD patients tend to have a higher risk of developing ACV encephalopathy and to recover more slowly. If CAPD patients develop ACV encephalopathy, a temporary change in the type of dialysis to hemodialysis should be considered.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '腹膜透析', 'relation': 'は血液透析と比較して', 'object': 'ACVの除去効率が不良であり、腹膜透析患者はACV脳症発症のリスクが高く回復も遅い傾向にある'}

**Score: 2 (Direct match)**

**Reasoning:**
The Japanese triple states:  
- Subject: 腹膜透析 (peritoneal dialysis)
- Relation: は血液透析と比較して (compared to hemodialysis)
- Object: ACVの除去効率が不良であり、腹膜透析患者はACV脳症発症のリスクが高く回復も遅い傾向にある (ACV clearance is poorer, and peritoneal dialysis patients tend to have a higher risk of developing ACV encephalopathy and recover more slowly)

In the English abstract, the following sentence directly expresses this knowledge:
> "Because CAPD provides a poorer ACV clearance than hemodialysis, CAPD patients tend to have a higher risk of developing ACV encephalopathy and to recover more slowly."

This sentence matches the Japanese triple almost word-for-word:
- CAPD (Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis) = 腹膜透析
- Poorer ACV clearance than hemodialysis = 血液透析と比較してACVの除去効率が不良
- Higher risk of ACV encephalopathy and slower recovery = ACV脳症発症のリスクが高く回復も遅い傾向

**Identified sentence:**
> "Because CAPD provides a poorer ACV clearance than hemodialysis, CAPD patients tend to have a higher risk of developing ACV encephalopathy and to recover more slowly."

**Conclusion:**  
The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract. Score: **2**.
