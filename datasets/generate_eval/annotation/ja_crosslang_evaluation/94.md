English abstract: The sensitivity of ultrasound to detect liquid components in the thoracic cavity is very high, and it is possible to visualize even very small pleural effusions that cannot be discerned by X-ray. There have been many reports that ultrasonography is useful for the diagnosis of pleural effusion, including empyema. However, there have been few reports of chest wall abscess. We report a case of empyema necessitatis that was diagnosed with ultrasonography from the body surface. A 69-year-old man had a mass on the right chest wall during the postoperative course of gastric and lung cancer. He was diagnosed with pleural recurrence of lung cancer and was suspected to have subcutaneous infiltration based on chest CT, and was admitted to the hospital for referral. Ultrasonography showed pleural effusion and oval hypoechoic lesions in the chest wall. A fistula between the pleural cavity and the hypoechoic lesion in the chest wall was detected on ultrasonography. Pleural effusion was seen to flow from the pleural cavity to the chest wall to and fro. We suspected pyothorax necessitatis and made a diagnosis of pyothorax based on thoracentesis. The chest wall mass disappeared for the most part with thoracic drainage. Real-time observation using ultrasonography could be useful for the diagnosis of empyema necessitatis.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '超音波診断', 'relation': 'による胸腔内の液体成分の検出能は', 'object': '非常に高く、X線では指摘できないような極めて少量の胸水でも描出可能である'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 超音波診断 (Ultrasound diagnosis)
- Relation: による胸腔内の液体成分の検出能は (the ability to detect liquid components in the thoracic cavity by)
- Object: 非常に高く、X線では指摘できないような極めて少量の胸水でも描出可能である (is very high, and even very small pleural effusions that cannot be detected by X-ray can be visualized)

### English Abstract
**Relevant Sentence(s):**
> The sensitivity of ultrasound to detect liquid components in the thoracic cavity is very high, and it is possible to visualize even very small pleural effusions that cannot be discerned by X-ray.

### Reasoning
- The English abstract contains a sentence that directly matches the Japanese triple.
- The subject ("ultrasound diagnosis"), relation ("ability to detect liquid components in the thoracic cavity"), and object ("very high, can visualize even very small pleural effusions not detectable by X-ray") are all explicitly stated in the first sentence of the abstract.
- The knowledge is not only inferable but directly expressed in one sentence.

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Sentence(s) Identified
- "The sensitivity of ultrasound to detect liquid components in the thoracic cavity is very high, and it is possible to visualize even very small pleural effusions that cannot be discerned by X-ray."

---

**Summary:**  
The Japanese triple is directly and clearly supported by the first sentence of the English abstract. The cross-lingual correctness score is **2 (Direct match)**.
