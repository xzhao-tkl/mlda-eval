English abstract: A new type of impression tray to facilitate the taking of impressions for cleft patients was developed. It is often necessary to take impressions of infants for recording growth and make palatal plates for them, but it is difficult to fit the tray size to the width of the mouth and maxilla, especially in the cases of post-cheiloplasty. To deal with the difference between the width of the mouth and maxilla, a Width Variable Impression Tray was developed. The length and the width of maxilla of the infants with cleft lip and palate were measured on study models. Based on this data, it was decided to construct an impression tray wich was width-adjustable using screw and spring devices. Two sizes of trays were developed. The precision of the impression by the “ Width Variable Impression Tray ” was studied. The results using this tray were almost the same as the original study model taken with a conventional tray. This “ Width Variable Impression Tray ” is easy to use and will adapt to any size of ma xilla. Therefore, impressions can be taken easily and accurately for all cleft palate infants.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '口唇・口蓋裂児', 'relation': 'は必要がある', 'object': '口蓋床の製作や顎発育の記録のために印象採得を行う'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 口唇・口蓋裂児 (infants/children with cleft lip and palate)
- **Relation:** は必要がある (it is necessary)
- **Object:** 口蓋床の製作や顎発育の記録のために印象採得を行う (to take impressions for making palatal plates and recording maxillary growth)

### English Abstract
Relevant sentences:
> "It is often necessary to take impressions of infants for recording growth and make palatal plates for them, but it is difficult to fit the tray size to the width of the mouth and maxilla, especially in the cases of post-cheiloplasty."

### Reasoning
- The English abstract directly states that "it is often necessary to take impressions of infants for recording growth and make palatal plates for them," which matches the Japanese triple's object ("口蓋床の製作や顎発育の記録のために印象採得を行う").
- The subject in the English abstract is "infants," and the context is cleft patients, which matches "口唇・口蓋裂児."
- The relation "は必要がある" (is necessary) is directly reflected in "it is often necessary."

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**  
The same knowledge is clearly expressed in one sentence in the abstract.

### Supporting Sentence(s)
- "It is often necessary to take impressions of infants for recording growth and make palatal plates for them, but it is difficult to fit the tray size to the width of the mouth and maxilla, especially in the cases of post-cheiloplasty."

**Summary:**  
The Japanese triple is directly supported by the English abstract, with a clear one-to-one correspondence in meaning.
