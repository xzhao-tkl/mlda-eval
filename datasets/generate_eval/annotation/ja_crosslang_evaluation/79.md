English abstract: Metastatic （M1） disease is the state in which a malignant tumor has generalized and the principal treatment is drug therapy.  However, for head and neck cancer with distant metastases at initial presentation, local control is important for maintaining Quality of Life （QOL）.  We retrospectively reviewed 11 cases of head and neck cancer with distant metastases at initial presentation at our hospital from January 2014 to June 2016.  Initial treatments were classified as follows: no treatment group, drug therapy group, and chemoradiotherapy group.  Local control rate and median survival time were 0％ and 4 months in the no treatment group, 0％ and 10 months in the drug therapy group, and 83％ and 20 months in the chemoradiotherapy group.  Chemoradiotherapy was useful for long-term control of a locoregional site and for maintenance of QOL.  In addition, chemoradiotherapy may be a useful treatment option for M1 disease patients for improving prognosis.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '頭頸部癌症例（遠隔転移を有する場合）', 'relation': 'において重要となるのは', 'object': '原発巣や頸部リンパ節転移による窒息・出血・嚥下不能状態の回避とQuality of Life(QOL)の維持、局所制御'}

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

### 1. Understanding the Japanese triple

- **Subject:** 頭頸部癌症例（遠隔転移を有する場合）  
  (Head and neck cancer cases (with distant metastases))
- **Relation:** において重要となるのは  
  (What is important in this context is)
- **Object:** 原発巣や頸部リンパ節転移による窒息・出血・嚥下不能状態の回避とQuality of Life(QOL)の維持、局所制御  
  (Avoidance of suffocation, bleeding, and inability to swallow due to primary lesion or cervical lymph node metastasis, maintenance of Quality of Life (QOL), and local control)

### 2. English abstract analysis

- The abstract discusses metastatic (M1) head and neck cancer.
- It states:  
  "for head and neck cancer with distant metastases at initial presentation, local control is important for maintaining Quality of Life (QOL)."
- It also mentions:  
  "Chemoradiotherapy was useful for long-term control of a locoregional site and for maintenance of QOL."
- The abstract does not explicitly mention "avoidance of suffocation, bleeding, and inability to swallow," but it does focus on local control and QOL maintenance, which are closely related to those clinical outcomes.

### 3. Cross-lingual correctness evaluation

#### Direct match (Score 2)
- The Japanese triple says that for head and neck cancer with distant metastases, what is important is local control, maintenance of QOL, and avoidance of severe symptoms (suffocation, bleeding, swallowing inability).
- The English abstract directly states that local control is important for maintaining QOL in these patients.
- The specific symptoms (suffocation, bleeding, swallowing inability) are not explicitly mentioned in the English abstract, but the concept of local control and QOL maintenance encompasses the avoidance of such severe symptoms in clinical practice.

#### Inferable (Score 1)
- If we require the explicit mention of the symptoms, the abstract does not provide them.
- However, the abstract does make it clear that local control and QOL are important, which is the core of the Japanese triple.

### 4. Sentence identification

- **Directly relevant sentences:**
  - "for head and neck cancer with distant metastases at initial presentation, local control is important for maintaining Quality of Life (QOL)."
  - "Chemoradiotherapy was useful for long-term control of a locoregional site and for maintenance of QOL."

### 5. Final score and justification

**Score: 2 (Direct match)**

**Justification:**  
The English abstract directly expresses that in head and neck cancer with distant metastases, local control and maintenance of QOL are important, which matches the Japanese triple. While the specific symptoms are not listed, the concept of local control and QOL maintenance in this context inherently includes the avoidance of severe local symptoms (suffocation, bleeding, swallowing inability), as these are the main threats to QOL in such patients.

**Relevant sentences:**  
- "for head and neck cancer with distant metastases at initial presentation, local control is important for maintaining Quality of Life (QOL)."
- "Chemoradiotherapy was useful for long-term control of a locoregional site and for maintenance of QOL."
