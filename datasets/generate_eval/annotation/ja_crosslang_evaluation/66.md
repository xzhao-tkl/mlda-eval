English abstract: Recently, it was found that Apo B comprises Apo B-48, derived from the small intestine, and Apo B-100, derived from the liver, and metabolic differences between them have been investigated. Nestel and the present authors have noted that a higher ratio of Apo B-48 is recognizable in triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. However, since the cause of this retention of Apo B-48 in VLDL was entirely unknown, we clinically studied the acceleration of retention and inhibitory factors. As Apo B-48 ratios in VLDL (Apo B-48/(Apo B-100+Apo B-48)) were higher than those in healthy subjects, positive correlations with plasma TG levels and total amounts of VLDL were noted. The ratio of Apo B-48 in VLDL was increased when lipids were orally loaded. As for the changes before and after hemodialysis, the Apo B-48 ratio in VLDL was decreased 2h after hemodialysis using heparin as an anticoagulant. Similarly, when Apo E was increased and Apo C was decreased in VLDL 2h after hemodialysis using heparin as an anticoagulant, the Apo E/C ratio was increased. On the other hand, before and after hemodialysis using gabexate mesilate (FOY) as an anticoagulant, no changes were noted in VLDL-fraction Apo B-48, Apo E and Apo C. It was suggested from the above findings that an increase of Apo E and a decrease of Apo C are important in the metabolism of Apo B-48 in the liver of patients with hemodialysis, and that Apo B-48 is more easily metabolized in the liver when the Apo E/C ratio is increased.

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 透析患者 (hemodialysis patients)
- **Relation:** では (in)
- **Object:** VLDL分画Apo B-48比 (Apo B-48/(Apo B-100+Apo B-48)) が健常人に比べ高値である (the ratio of Apo B-48 in VLDL is higher compared to healthy subjects)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Relevant Sentence(s)
> "As Apo B-48 ratios in VLDL (Apo B-48/(Apo B-100+Apo B-48)) were higher than those in healthy subjects, positive correlations with plasma TG levels and total amounts of VLDL were noted."

#### Reasoning
- The English abstract explicitly states that the ratio of Apo B-48 in VLDL is higher in a certain group compared to healthy subjects.
- The context of the abstract is about patients with chronic renal insufficiency and those undergoing hemodialysis.
- The Japanese triple specifically refers to "透析患者" (hemodialysis patients), and the abstract discusses changes in Apo B-48 ratios in VLDL in these patients, comparing them to healthy subjects.

### Score: **2 (Direct match)**
- The knowledge triple is directly and clearly expressed in the English abstract in one sentence.

#### Sentence(s) Supporting the Triple
- "As Apo B-48 ratios in VLDL (Apo B-48/(Apo B-100+Apo B-48)) were higher than those in healthy subjects, positive correlations with plasma TG levels and total amounts of VLDL were noted."

### Final Evaluation
- **Score:** 2
- **Supporting Sentence:** See above.
- **Reasoning:** The English abstract directly states that the ratio of Apo B-48 in VLDL is higher in hemodialysis patients compared to healthy subjects, matching the Japanese triple exactly.
