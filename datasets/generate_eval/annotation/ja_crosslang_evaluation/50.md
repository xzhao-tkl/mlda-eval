English abstract: Objective：To describe two cases of postoperative septic shock after endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery（ECIRS）that were managed well by early recognition and early intervention by anesthesiologists. Case presentation：［Case 1］ECIRS was performed to treat a stone in the left kidney of a 56-year-old woman. She fell into a state of shock immediately after removal of her tracheal tube in the operating room. She was diagnosed with sepsis based on quick SOFA score and other findings and was treated in the intensive care unit for three days.［Case 2］ECIRS was performed to treat stones in the right kidney of a 39-year-old woman who suffered from recurrent urinary tract infections. After the procedure, her condition deteriorated during her stay in the postanesthesia care unit. She was treated in the intensive care unit for three days for septic shock. Conclusion：Although its incidence is rare, septic shock is one of the most important complications associated with patients who have undergone ECIRS.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'ECIRS後に全身状態が悪化した症例', 'relation': 'で敗血症性ショックを鑑別にあげることで', 'object': '敗血症に対する集中治療を早期に開始できる'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** ECIRS後に全身状態が悪化した症例 (Cases where general condition worsened after ECIRS)
- **Relation:** で敗血症性ショックを鑑別にあげることで (by considering septic shock as a differential diagnosis)
- **Object:** 敗血症に対する集中治療を早期に開始できる (can start intensive care for sepsis early)

### English Abstract Analysis

The abstract describes two cases where patients' conditions worsened after ECIRS. In both cases, septic shock was recognized early (by anesthesiologists), and intensive care for sepsis was started promptly.

#### Relevant Sentences:
1. "She was diagnosed with sepsis based on quick SOFA score and other findings and was treated in the intensive care unit for three days."
2. "She was treated in the intensive care unit for three days for septic shock."
3. "Objective：To describe two cases of postoperative septic shock after endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery（ECIRS）that were managed well by early recognition and early intervention by anesthesiologists."
4. "Conclusion：Although its incidence is rare, septic shock is one of the most important complications associated with patients who have undergone ECIRS."

#### Reasoning

- The subject ("cases where general condition worsened after ECIRS") matches the two cases described.
- The relation ("by considering septic shock as a differential diagnosis") is reflected in the early recognition and diagnosis of septic shock/sepsis by anesthesiologists.
- The object ("can start intensive care for sepsis early") is directly supported by the fact that both patients were promptly treated in the ICU for sepsis/septic shock.

The knowledge triple is not expressed in a single sentence, but the abstract as a whole clearly supports the inference: early consideration/recognition of septic shock in patients whose condition worsens after ECIRS allows for early initiation of intensive care for sepsis.

### Score: **1 (Inferable)**

#### Supporting Sentences:
- "She was diagnosed with sepsis based on quick SOFA score and other findings and was treated in the intensive care unit for three days."
- "She was treated in the intensive care unit for three days for septic shock."
- "Objective：To describe two cases of postoperative septic shock after endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery（ECIRS）that were managed well by early recognition and early intervention by anesthesiologists."

### Summary
The Japanese triple is inferable from the English abstract, as the cases described demonstrate that early consideration of septic shock in patients with deteriorating condition after ECIRS leads to early intensive care for sepsis. The knowledge is supported by multiple sentences in the abstract.
