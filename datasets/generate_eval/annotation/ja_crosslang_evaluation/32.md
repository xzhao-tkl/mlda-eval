English abstract: A well-characterized early histone modification that is triggered by DNA is the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the histone variant H2AX. This occurs minutes after the formation of DNA double strand breaks and leads to enhanced access by proteins, including NBS1 and others, that participate in homologous recombination-mediated repair However, it is likely that another histone modification could be involved in this DNA repair pathway because H2AX knock out cells still display a normal localization of RAD51, a key protein in HRR, to sites of DSBs and exhibit significant HRR activity. We report here that, after exposure to ionizing radiation, H2B is mono-ubiquitinated independently of H2AX modification and plays a critical role in RAD51-mediated HRR of DSBs. RNF20, an E3 ubiquitin ligase implicated in chromatin remodeling for transcription, forms IR-induced nuclear foci and promotes H2B mono-ubiquitination 1.5 hours post-irradiation, and this is followed by the release of H2B and H3 from chromatin. Surprisingly, the formation of IR-induced foci containing RAD51 and BRCA1 was substantially suppressed by decreased RNF20 expression or by a mutation of the ubiquitinated amino acid residue in H2B. Consistent with these data, depletion of RNF20 interfered with the accumulation of RAD51 and BRCA1 in chromatin and resulted in a pronounced reduction in HRR. As a result, RNF20 down-regulation significantly enhanced sensitivity to mitomycin C and IR. Moreover, RNF20-deficient phenotypes were corrected in part by chromatin decondensation using a histone deacetylase inhibitor, but IR-induced H2B ubiquitination was not affected by the addition of transcription inhibitors, suggesting the existence of transcription-independent chromatin reorganization activity at DSB sites by RNF20.

- Relation: は  
- Object: DNA修復において非常に重要である  
(Translation: "The modification (phosphorylation, ubiquitination) of histone H2AX triggered by DNA damage is very important in DNA repair.")

**English Abstract Analysis:**  
The abstract states:  
> "A well-characterized early histone modification that is triggered by DNA is the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the histone variant H2AX. This occurs minutes after the formation of DNA double strand breaks and leads to enhanced access by proteins, including NBS1 and others, that participate in homologous recombination-mediated repair..."

This sentence directly describes that H2AX phosphorylation and ubiquitination (triggered by DNA damage) is an early and important event in DNA repair, specifically facilitating access for repair proteins.

**Score Reasoning:**  
- **Score = 2 (Direct match):**  
The knowledge triple is directly and clearly expressed in the first sentence of the abstract. The modification of H2AX (phosphorylation and ubiquitination) triggered by DNA damage is described as a well-characterized and early event that is important for DNA repair.

**Supporting Sentence(s):**  
- "A well-characterized early histone modification that is triggered by DNA is the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of the histone variant H2AX. This occurs minutes after the formation of DNA double strand breaks and leads to enhanced access by proteins, including NBS1 and others, that participate in homologous recombination-mediated repair..."

**Reasoning:**  
The abstract explicitly states that H2AX modification (phosphorylation and ubiquitination) is triggered by DNA damage and is important for DNA repair, matching the Japanese triple both in content and context.
