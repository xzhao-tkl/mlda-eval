English abstract: We report a case of abdominal pain associated with the intrapancreatic residual bile duct (BD) after an operation of anomalous arrangement of the pancreaticobiliary duct (AAPBD). A 36-year-old man, who had undergone a cholecystectomy and partial resection of the extrahepatic BD with hepaticojejunostomy for AAPBD with dilated BD, had occasional abdominal pain after the operation. We conducted a total resection of the intrapancreatic residual BD under a diagnosis of intrapancreatic residual cholangitis. We exfoliated the intrapancreatic residual BD to the confluence of the pancreatic and BD in the pancreas, which was completely resected after ligation of the BD terminal. There have been many reports referring to malignant changes of intrahepatic residual BD after an initial operation for AAPBD. Therefore, complete resection of the extrahepatic BD, including the intrapancreatic region is essential in the operation for AAPBD. Moreover, when the residual BD in the pancreas is found, reoperation for complete resection of the BD should be considered.

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 膵胆管合流異常症の手術 (Operation for anomalous arrangement of the pancreaticobiliary duct, AAPBD)
- **Relation:** にあたって重要である (is important in/for)
- **Object:** 肝外胆管の完全切除 (complete resection of the extrahepatic bile duct)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Relevant Sentences:
1. "Therefore, complete resection of the extrahepatic BD, including the intrapancreatic region is essential in the operation for AAPBD."
2. "Moreover, when the residual BD in the pancreas is found, reoperation for complete resection of the BD should be considered."

#### Reasoning
- The first sentence directly states that "complete resection of the extrahepatic BD... is essential in the operation for AAPBD." This matches the Japanese triple, which says that complete resection of the extrahepatic bile duct is important in the operation for AAPBD.
- The subject (operation for AAPBD), the object (complete resection of extrahepatic bile duct), and the relation (is important/essential) are all present in one sentence.

### Score: **2** (Direct match)

#### Sentence(s) Identified:
- "Therefore, complete resection of the extrahepatic BD, including the intrapancreatic region is essential in the operation for AAPBD."

### Summary
The knowledge triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract, with all elements present in a single sentence. The cross-lingual correctness score is **2**.
