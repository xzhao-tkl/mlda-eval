English abstract: We conducted a comparative study of two cases of treatment of bursitis associated with a rotator cuff tear in the elderly: a case in which steroid arthropathy developed as a result of repeated steroid injections, and a case in which hyaluronic acid injections had been used. Underlying disease, bone fragility, external force, etc., as well as steroid dose, number of doses, and period of time, were among the factors present in the development of steroid arthropathy. Local rest is important in the treatment of bursitis associated with rotator cuff tears, and hyaluronic acid injections are desirable when the inflammation persists.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'ステロイド関節症の発症', 'relation': 'には影響する要因として', 'object': 'ステロイド量、回数、期間以外に基礎疾患、骨の脆弱性、外力が存在する'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

**Japanese triple:**  
- Subject: ステロイド関節症の発症 (Development of steroid arthropathy)
- Relation: には影響する要因として (as influencing factors)
- Object: ステロイド量、回数、期間以外に基礎疾患、骨の脆弱性、外力が存在する (Besides steroid dose, number of doses, and period, underlying disease, bone fragility, and external force are present)

**English abstract:**  
"Underlying disease, bone fragility, external force, etc., as well as steroid dose, number of doses, and period of time, were among the factors present in the development of steroid arthropathy."

### Reasoning

- The English abstract directly states that "Underlying disease, bone fragility, external force, etc., as well as steroid dose, number of doses, and period of time, were among the factors present in the development of steroid arthropathy."
- This matches the Japanese triple, which lists the same factors (underlying disease, bone fragility, external force) in addition to steroid-related factors as influencing the development of steroid arthropathy.
- The knowledge is expressed in a single sentence in the English abstract.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Sentence(s) supporting the triple

- "Underlying disease, bone fragility, external force, etc., as well as steroid dose, number of doses, and period of time, were among the factors present in the development of steroid arthropathy."

**Conclusion:**  
The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract.
