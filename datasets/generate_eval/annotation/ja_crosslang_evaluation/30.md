English abstract: Based on our own 35 cases treated with kobokushichimotsuto as well as our predecessors' experience and their opinions, we investigated the drug's mechanism of action and its background indications. Our predecessors' opinions seem to be divided into two groups. Group A : An external pattern/syndrome (a keishito indication) of external contraction, followed by an interior heat pattern/syndrome (a kobokusammotsuto indication) appear. Mechanism of disease wise, this means that both external and internal patterns/syndromes exist at the same time. Because an internal pattern/syndrome is heavier than an external one, both patterns/syndromes are simultaneously treated, by making both medicinals bound together. Group B : Internal heat due to yang exuberance with yin debilitation is the mechanism of disease here. In group A, cause of disease is classed as a true heat pattern/syndrome. In group B, depending whether the internal heat belongs to either true heat or false type, deficiency and excess of pulse/abdominal patterns/syndromes change, and appetite differs. In either group, no peony is used to cope with the chest pattern/syndrome induced by the progression of gastric heat into the chest. Our cases consisted of upper respiratory illnesses with appetite loss, gastrointestinal diseases with chest oppression, respiratory diseases and intestinal obstructions. Kobokushichimotsuto, however, can be applied to neuroses, mental disorders and low back pains.

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 内熱が実熱証に属するか虚熱証に属するか (Whether internal heat belongs to true heat pattern/syndrome or false heat pattern/syndrome)
- **Relation:** によって (depending on / according to)
- **Object:** 脈候、腹候の虚実、食思の程度が異なる (the deficiency and excess of pulse/abdominal patterns/syndromes and the degree of appetite differ)

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant sentence from the abstract:
> In group B, depending whether the internal heat belongs to either true heat or false type, deficiency and excess of pulse/abdominal patterns/syndromes change, and appetite differs.

#### Reasoning

- The subject ("whether internal heat belongs to true heat or false type") matches the Japanese triple's subject.
- The relation ("depending on") is directly expressed as "depending whether".
- The object ("deficiency and excess of pulse/abdominal patterns/syndromes change, and appetite differs") matches the Japanese triple's object.

This knowledge is **directly stated in one sentence** in the English abstract.

### Score: **2** (Direct match)
