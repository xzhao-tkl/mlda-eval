English abstract: Tannins and related phenolic compounds have chlating ability with metal ions and antimicrobial activity. We studied on inhibitory effect of phenolic compounds on chlorpyrifos degradation by metal ions and soil microorganisms. As a result, phenolic compounds could mitigate one enable to reduce chlorpyrifos degradation by metal ions and soil microorganisms. Pyrogallol and gallic acid shows the most positive effects on inhibition of chlorpyrifos degradation among all phenolic compounds tested.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'タンニンとフェノール類', 'relation': 'は軽減できる', 'object': '金属イオンが関与する分解と土壌微生物が関与する分解'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** タンニンとフェノール類 (Tannins and phenolic compounds)
- **Relation:** は軽減できる (can mitigate/reduce)
- **Object:** 金属イオンが関与する分解と土壌微生物が関与する分解 (degradation involving metal ions and soil microorganisms)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Key Sentences:
1. "Tannins and related phenolic compounds have chlating ability with metal ions and antimicrobial activity."
2. "We studied on inhibitory effect of phenolic compounds on chlorpyrifos degradation by metal ions and soil microorganisms."
3. "As a result, phenolic compounds could mitigate one enable to reduce chlorpyrifos degradation by metal ions and soil microorganisms."
4. "Pyrogallol and gallic acid shows the most positive effects on inhibition of chlorpyrifos degradation among all phenolic compounds tested."

#### Reasoning

- The triple states that tannins and phenolic compounds can mitigate (reduce) degradation processes that involve metal ions and soil microorganisms.
- The abstract directly discusses the inhibitory effect of phenolic compounds (including tannins) on the degradation of chlorpyrifos by metal ions and soil microorganisms.
- Sentence 3 explicitly says: "phenolic compounds could mitigate one enable to reduce chlorpyrifos degradation by metal ions and soil microorganisms." This matches the triple's meaning: phenolic compounds (including tannins) can reduce the degradation (分解) caused by metal ions and soil microorganisms.
- The subject, relation, and object in the triple are all present in this sentence.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence(s)

- "As a result, phenolic compounds could mitigate one enable to reduce chlorpyrifos degradation by metal ions and soil microorganisms."

### Summary

The knowledge triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract, specifically in the sentence above. The triple's meaning is expressed in one sentence, so the score is 2.
