English abstract: Identification of meats of closely related species is an important problem for determination of the addition of undeclared meat in a ground meat mixture or processed meat mixture or processed meat product. Many attemqts have been made for mammalian meats but not for poultry meats. This paper describes a method which distinguishes immunologically between chicken's, turkey's duck's and quail's meat by using agar gel precipitation method. The antisera were made from rabbits and chickens immunized with the water extracts of the above poultry meats as follows: 1st day, 1ml of a meat extract with Freund complete adjuvant into the pale and muscle of each animal; 3rd week, 0.2ml of the extract only as a booster injection. The sufficient antibody titers were usually obtained 4 weeks later after the first injection in rabbits and 6 week in chickens. The unabsorbed antisera made from rabbits were cross-reacted to poultry meats but not reacted to mammalian meats. However, these cross-reactions could be removed by absorption with small amounts of the meat extracts of the cross-reacting species, and the absorbed antisera were made specific for the homologous species. The antisera made from chicken were usually specific for homologous species even before absorption, but the antibody titers were not so high as those of the rabbit antisera. Original Ouchterlony's method was improved by decreasing the distances among an antibody well and antigen wells on agar gel plate. By this method, a specific antiserumm could detect about 0.5mg/ml of protein in a saline extract of meat.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '肉の種属鑑別法の術式', 'relation': 'として適当である', 'object': 'Ouchterlony法を改良した寒天ゲル内沈降反応'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 肉の種属鑑別法の術式 (Method for identification of meat species)
- **Relation:** として適当である (is suitable/appropriate as)
- **Object:** Ouchterlony法を改良した寒天ゲル内沈降反応 (Modified Ouchterlony agar gel precipitation method)

### English Abstract Analysis

The abstract states:
> "This paper describes a method which distinguishes immunologically between chicken's, turkey's duck's and quail's meat by using agar gel precipitation method."
> "Original Ouchterlony's method was improved by decreasing the distances among an antibody well and antigen wells on agar gel plate. By this method, a specific antiserum could detect about 0.5mg/ml of protein in a saline extract of meat."

This clearly indicates that the improved Ouchterlony agar gel precipitation method is used for the identification of meat species (specifically poultry). The abstract presents the method as suitable for this purpose.

### Reasoning

- The subject ("method for identification of meat species") is directly discussed in the abstract.
- The object ("modified Ouchterlony agar gel precipitation method") is described as the technique used.
- The relation ("is suitable as") is implied by the context: the method is presented as effective and appropriate for the identification task.

### Sentence(s) Supporting the Triple
