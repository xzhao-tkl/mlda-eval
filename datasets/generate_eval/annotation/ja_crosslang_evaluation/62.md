English abstract: A Res-O-Mat Fe kit is used for an in vitro measurement of the unsaturated iron binding capacity in serum. A resin strip is utilized as adsorbent of residual radioiron after the serum was saturated with radioiron. The unsaturated iron-binding capacity were measured in 53 sera using this kit and Irosorb-test kit, in which a resin sponge is used for adsorbent of radioiron. Results of these tests show a nearly linear correlation. This test is easy to manipulate and the reproducibility test with same sera also was satisfactory. The normal range of unsaturated iron-binding capacity determined using this test kit was as follows.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '本検査法', 'relation': 'によって', 'object': '血清不飽和鉄結合能を測定できる'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 本検査法 (this test method)
- **Relation:** によって (by/using)
- **Object:** 血清不飽和鉄結合能を測定できる (can measure unsaturated iron-binding capacity in serum)

### English Abstract
The abstract states:
> "A Res-O-Mat Fe kit is used for an in vitro measurement of the unsaturated iron binding capacity in serum."

### Reasoning
- The Japanese triple claims that "by this test method, the unsaturated iron-binding capacity in serum can be measured."
- The English abstract directly says that the Res-O-Mat Fe kit is used for measuring the unsaturated iron-binding capacity in serum.
- "本検査法" (this test method) in the Japanese triple refers to the method described in the abstract (using the Res-O-Mat Fe kit).
- The relation "によって" (by/using) matches the usage of the kit for measurement.
- The object "血清不飽和鉄結合能を測定できる" (can measure unsaturated iron-binding capacity in serum) is directly stated in the abstract.

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence(s)
- "A Res-O-Mat Fe kit is used for an in vitro measurement of the unsaturated iron binding capacity in serum."

This sentence directly expresses the same knowledge as the Japanese triple.

**Final Evaluation:**  
Score: **2**  
Supporting sentence: "A Res-O-Mat Fe kit is used for an in vitro measurement of the unsaturated iron binding capacity in serum."  
Reasoning: The abstract directly states that the test method (Res-O-Mat Fe kit) is used to measure unsaturated iron-binding capacity in serum, which matches the Japanese triple.
