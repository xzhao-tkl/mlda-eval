English abstract: Azthreonam (SQ 26, 776), a novel synthetic monocyclic (β-lactam antibiotic was evaluated fundamentally and clinically to provide following facts; 1) Antimicrobial activity: AZT was specifically active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa. Its activity against E. coli, K. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, E. cloacae, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa was in general equal or superior to that of the third-generation cephems such as CPZ, CTX, CZX and LMOX. 2) Azthreonam Ievel in serum and sputum: AZT was drip infused for one hour to three patients with chronic respiratory infections at a dose of 1.0 gram or 2.0 gram, and its serum and sputum levels were assayed microbiologically. The peak serum levels were 68-110 ig/ml with the dose of 1.0 gram and 124 μg/ml with the dose of 2.0 gram at the end of drip infusion. The peak sputum levels were 0.76-5.2 μg/ml at one to five hours after infusion. The average ratio of peak levels in sputum to those in serum was 2.03%. 3) Clinical results: AZT was administered to 50 patients with various respiratory infections. Out of 50 patients, clinical response to AZT was excellent in 8, good in 26, fair in 5 and poor in 8, and 3 patients were not evaluable. The overall efficacy rate was 72.3%. Diarrhea occurred in one patient, and S-GOT and/or S-GPT values have transiently elevated mildly to moderately in 5 patient, and a mild eosinophilia occurred in one patient. Consequently, AZT is one of the useful antibiotics in treating the patients with respiratory infections due to aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '本剤', 'relation': 'は抗菌力が極めて強い', 'object': '緑膿菌を含むグラム陰性桿菌（E. coli, K. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosaなど）'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 本剤 (this drug; refers to Azthreonam)
- **Relation:** は抗菌力が極めて強い (has extremely strong antimicrobial activity)
- **Object:** 緑膿菌を含むグラム陰性桿菌（E. coli, K. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, E. cloacae, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosaなど） (Gram-negative bacilli including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, etc.)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Relevant Sentences:
1. "**AZT was specifically active against aerobic gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa.**"
2. "**Its activity against E. coli, K. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, E. cloacae, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa was in general equal or superior to that of the third-generation cephems such as CPZ, CTX, CZX and LMOX.**"

#### Reasoning
- The subject "本剤" refers to Azthreonam, which is the focus of the abstract.
- The relation "has extremely strong antimicrobial activity" is supported by the phrases "specifically active" and "equal or superior to third-generation cephems," which are considered very potent antibiotics. The comparison to third-generation cephems (which are known for strong activity) and the statement of "equal or superior" activity implies "extremely strong" antimicrobial power.
- The object, a list of gram-negative bacilli including P. aeruginosa, E. coli, etc., is directly mentioned in the abstract.

#### Sentence Identification
- The first sentence directly states activity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria including P. aeruginosa.
- The second sentence lists the specific bacteria and compares the activity to other strong antibiotics.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

- The triple is clearly and directly expressed in the abstract, especially in the first two sentences of the antimicrobial activity section.
