English abstract: Patients with diverticula of the small intestine are rare. A 49-year-old woman, who demonstrated multiple diverticulosis throughout the entire small intestine, underwent partial resection of the small intestine twice (10 months and 2 months before the present surgery) due to diverticulitis of the ileum. She developed severe abdominal pain and was admitted to hospital again. On CT image, ascites and perforated diverticulitis were noted. Surgery was performed with partial resection of the small intestine. The post operative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged. Thereafter, the patient was indicated for regular outpatient treatment. In Japan, there have been 11 case reports describing multiple diverticulosis of the small intestine, but none of the previously reported cases underwent repeated surgery within such a short time. Multiple diverticulosis of the small intestine are usually situated on the mesenterium side of the enteron, more commonly in the jejunum than in the ileum. However, diverticulitis often occurs in the lower ileum. This patient may develop another episode of severe diverticulitis in the future. Cases of multiple diverticulosis are rare, but may be encountered as an acute abdomen. However, there are no established therapies. To avoid short bowel syndrome due to repeated surgery, such patients should be treated carefully, and needed strict observation by a gastroenterologist.

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 頻回の手術 (frequent/repeated surgery)
- Relation: は (has/is)
- Object: 短腸症候群を来す恐れがある (risk of causing short bowel syndrome)

### English Abstract Analysis

We need to check if the English abstract supports the knowledge that "frequent/repeated surgery has a risk of causing short bowel syndrome."

#### Relevant Sentences in the Abstract

1. "In Japan, there have been 11 case reports describing multiple diverticulosis of the small intestine, but none of the previously reported cases underwent repeated surgery within such a short time."
2. "To avoid short bowel syndrome due to repeated surgery, such patients should be treated carefully, and needed strict observation by a gastroenterologist."

#### Reasoning

- Sentence 2 directly states: "To avoid short bowel syndrome due to repeated surgery, such patients should be treated carefully..."  
  This clearly expresses that repeated surgery carries a risk of causing short bowel syndrome, which matches the Japanese triple.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

- The knowledge triple is directly and clearly expressed in one sentence in the English abstract.

### Supporting Sentence

- "To avoid short bowel syndrome due to repeated surgery, such patients should be treated carefully, and needed strict observation by a gastroenterologist."
