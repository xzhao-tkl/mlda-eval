English abstract: In addition to the irregularities of the tooth size, shape or number which are of frequent occurence in cleft palate, the severe displacement or the abnormal inclination and the rotation of tooth is found around the cleft area. This study was undertaken in order to determine the incidence of irregularities of the central incisor, lateral incisor and canine in cleft lip and alveolus with or without cleft palate cases, and also to attempt to establish a proper orthodontic management for the abnormal teeth. A total of 145 cases with Hellman's dental stage III A ∼ IV A was studied. This sample included 19 unilateral cleft lip cases,4 bilateral cleft lip cases,98 unilateral cleft lip and palate cases, and 24 bilateral cleft lip and palate cases. Patient records were obtained from the file of the Department of Orthodontics,, Tokyo Medical and Dental University. The central incisor exhibited the high incidence of the abnormal dental axis, such as lingual tip, tip toward the cleft and rotation, and only 2.1% normalcy in the unilateral cleft lip and palate cases. The lateral incisor exhibited the high incidence of missing or hypoplastic variations, and 27.8% normalcy in the unilateral cleft lip cases. The canine exhibited the abnormal dental axis, such as toward the cleft and rotation, but higher incidence of normalcy than the central incisor and the lateral incisor. The management of these abnormal teeth were as follows; extraction or leaving as it was were limited to 8 cases, orthodontic tooth movement have been attempted on the rest of cases (137 cases) keeping the tooth materials to gain the rigid support for prosthetics. We concluded that the management of abn ormal teeth must be considered as a part of oral habilitation, the extraction of the teeth closest to a cleft leads to the disadvantage for the prosthodontic treatment.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '唇顎口蓋裂の治療', 'relation': 'においては', 'object': '顎裂に近接する歯をできる限り保存し、成長期患者の上顎への外科的侵襲を最少限にとどめ、将来の補綴処置にも不利にならないよう総合的な治療方針を立てる'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 唇顎口蓋裂の治療 (Treatment of cleft lip, alveolus, and palate)
- **Relation:** においては (in/with respect to)
- **Object:** 顎裂に近接する歯をできる限り保存し、成長期患者の上顎への外科的侵襲を最少限にとどめ、将来の補綴処置にも不利にならないよう総合的な治療方針を立てる (As much as possible, preserve teeth close to the alveolar cleft, minimize surgical intervention to the maxilla in growing patients, and establish a comprehensive treatment plan so as not to disadvantage future prosthetic treatment.)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Key Points in the Abstract:
- The study investigates irregularities of teeth in cleft lip/alveolus/palate cases and orthodontic management.
- "The management of these abnormal teeth were as follows; extraction or leaving as it was were limited to 8 cases, orthodontic tooth movement have been attempted on the rest of cases (137 cases) keeping the tooth materials to gain the rigid support for prosthetics."
- "We concluded that the management of abnormal teeth must be considered as a part of oral habilitation, the extraction of the teeth closest to a cleft leads to the disadvantage for the prosthodontic treatment."

#### Reasoning

The Japanese triple expresses three main ideas:
1. **Preserve teeth close to the cleft as much as possible.**
2. **Minimize surgical intervention to the maxilla in growing patients.**
3. **Establish a comprehensive treatment plan to avoid disadvantages for future prosthetic treatment.**

From the English abstract:
- The sentence "the extraction of the teeth closest to a cleft leads to the disadvantage for the prosthodontic treatment" directly supports the idea of preserving teeth near the cleft for future prosthetic advantage.
- The management section describes that extraction was limited, and most cases attempted to keep tooth material for prosthetic support, which aligns with the preservation aspect.
- The abstract does not explicitly mention minimizing surgical intervention to the maxilla in growing patients, but the overall tone is about careful, comprehensive management to avoid future disadvantages.

#### Sentence(s) Supporting the Triple
- "The management of these abnormal teeth were as follows; extraction or leaving as it was were limited to 8 cases, orthodontic tooth movement have been attempted on the rest of cases (137 cases) keeping the tooth materials to gain the rigid support for prosthetics."
- "We concluded that the management of abnormal teeth must be considered as a part of oral habilitation, the extraction of the teeth closest to a cleft leads to the disadvantage for the prosthodontic treatment."

### Score

**Score = 1 (Inferable)**

- The abstract does not state all elements of the Japanese triple in a single sentence, but the main ideas (preservation of teeth near the cleft, comprehensive management to avoid prosthetic disadvantage) can be reasonably inferred from the abstract as a whole.
- The aspect of minimizing surgical intervention to the maxilla in growing patients is not directly mentioned, but the general principle of careful management is present.

### Final Answer

**Score: 1 (Inferable)**

**Supporting sentences:**
- "The management of these abnormal teeth were as follows; extraction or leaving as it was were limited to 8 cases, orthodontic tooth movement have been attempted on the rest of cases (137 cases) keeping the tooth materials to gain the rigid support for prosthetics."
- "We concluded that the management of abnormal teeth must be considered as a part of oral habilitation, the extraction of the teeth closest to a cleft leads to the disadvantage for the prosthodontic treatment."

**Reasoning:**  
The abstract supports the idea of preserving teeth near the cleft and establishing a comprehensive treatment plan to avoid disadvantages for future prosthetic treatment, which matches the Japanese triple. However, the minimization of surgical intervention to the maxilla in growing patients is not explicitly stated, so the match is inferable but not direct.
