English abstract: Staphylococcus aureus causes various diseases against humans, including skin infection, pneumonia, food poisoning, and meningitis. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is resistant to a broad range of antibiotics, causing serious clinical problems. In this review, I summarize our studies to evaluate S. aureus virulence and identify novel virulence regulators. First, we utilized silkworms as an infection model of S. aureus and identified novel virulence factors of S. aureus. Some of the virulence factors interact with RNA in bacterial cells and regulate the expression of virulence factors. Second, we found that S. aureus cells spread on soft agar plates and form a giant colony. We call this phenomenon colony-spreading. High virulence community-acquired MRSA exhibits higher colony-spreading activity than hospital-associated MRSA. The difference in colony spreading is attributed to a specific gene in the mobile genetic element SCCmec carried by hospital-associated MRSA. The gene transcription product inhibits translation of a master regulator against S. aureus virulence genes, resulting in the attenuation of colony-spreading, exotoxin production, and animal killing ability.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '黄色ブドウ球菌', 'relation': 'はヒトに対して引き起こす', 'object': '表在性膿瘍、肺炎、食中毒、髄膜炎など様々な疾患'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 黄色ブドウ球菌 (Staphylococcus aureus)
- Relation: はヒトに対して引き起こす (causes in humans)
- Object: 表在性膿瘍、肺炎、食中毒、髄膜炎など様々な疾患 (various diseases such as skin infection, pneumonia, food poisoning, and meningitis)

### English Abstract
> Staphylococcus aureus causes various diseases against humans, including skin infection, pneumonia, food poisoning, and meningitis.

### Reasoning
The English abstract directly states that "Staphylococcus aureus causes various diseases against humans, including skin infection, pneumonia, food poisoning, and meningitis." This matches the Japanese triple exactly in terms of subject (Staphylococcus aureus), relation (causes in humans), and object (the list of diseases).

### Sentence Identification
The relevant sentence is:
> "Staphylococcus aureus causes various diseases against humans, including skin infection, pneumonia, food poisoning, and meningitis."

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match — same triple is clearly expressed in one sentence in the abstract.**

### Summary
The knowledge triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract, with an exact match in one sentence.
