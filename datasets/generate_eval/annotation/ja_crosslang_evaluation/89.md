English abstract: Apoptosis can trigger compensatory proliferation of surrounding cells to maintain tissue homeostasis. While oxidative stress is tightly associated with apoptosis and necrosis, it remains unknown whether oxidative stress contributes to compensatory proliferation. We show that interleukin (IL)-11, a member of the IL-6 family, is produced by cells in an oxidative stress-dependent manner. IL-11 production largely depends on oxidative stress-mediated ERK2 activation, which in turn induces phosphorylation and accumulation of the transcription factor Fra-1 by preventing its proteasome-dependent degradation. Fra-1 is subsequently recruited to the Il11 promoter and activates transcription. Upon acute liver injuries in mice, IL-11 is mainly produced by hepatocytes in response to reactive oxygen species that are presumably released from dying hepatocytes. IL-11 induces phosphorylation of STAT3 in adjacent live hepatocytes, resulting in compensatory proliferation. Furthermore, administration of an IL-11 agonist enhances proliferation of hepatocytes and ameliorates oxidative stress upon acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury. Conversely, APAP-induced liver injury is exacerbated in Il11 receptor alpha 1-/- mice. Collectively, these results suggest that IL-11 provides a functional link between oxidative stress and compensatory proliferation.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'IL-11アゴニストの投与', 'relation': 'により', 'object': 'アセトアミノフェン(APAP)誘導性肝障害が改善し、肝細胞の代償性増殖が亢進する'}

## Reasoning

**Japanese triple:**  
- Subject: IL-11アゴニストの投与 (Administration of IL-11 agonist)  
- Relation: により (by/through)  
- Object: アセトアミノフェン(APAP)誘導性肝障害が改善し、肝細胞の代償性増殖が亢進する (APAP-induced liver injury is ameliorated, and compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes is enhanced)

**English abstract:**  
Relevant sentence:  
> "Furthermore, administration of an IL-11 agonist enhances proliferation of hepatocytes and ameliorates oxidative stress upon acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury."

**Analysis:**  
- The Japanese triple states that administration of an IL-11 agonist leads to improvement of APAP-induced liver injury and increased compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes.
- The English abstract directly states that administration of an IL-11 agonist "enhances proliferation of hepatocytes and ameliorates oxidative stress upon acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury."
- While the English abstract specifically mentions amelioration of oxidative stress (not liver injury per se), the context is "upon APAP-induced liver injury," and the implication is that the injury is improved via reduction of oxidative stress and increased proliferation.
- The enhancement of hepatocyte proliferation is directly mentioned.
- The improvement of APAP-induced liver injury is reasonably inferred from the amelioration of oxidative stress and increased proliferation, both of which are beneficial in the context of liver injury.

**Sentence(s) supporting the triple:**  
- "Furthermore, administration of an IL-11 agonist enhances proliferation of hepatocytes and ameliorates oxidative stress upon acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury."

## Score

**Score: 1 (Inferable)**

- The triple is not expressed in a single sentence, but the information can be reasonably inferred from the abstract. The improvement of liver injury is implied through the amelioration of oxidative stress and increased proliferation, both of which are described as effects of IL-11 agonist administration in the context of APAP-induced liver injury.
