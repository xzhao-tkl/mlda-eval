English abstract: We herein report two cases of torsion of the gallbladder. Case 1:A 78-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of hypochondralgia, nausea and vomiting. A mass measuring 5 cm in diameter was palpable in the right lateral region of the abdomen. Computed Tomography (CT) and ultrasonogaphy (US) were performed and she was diagnosed as to have torsion of the gallbladder. An open cholecystectomy was performed. The gallbladder was free-floating and rotated clockwise. Case 2:A 90-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital because of hypochondralgia. A mass measuring 5 cm in diameter was palpable in the right lateral region of the abdomen. CT and US were performed and she was diagnosed as to have torsion of the gallbladder. An open cholecystectomy was performed. The gallbladder was free-floating and rotated counterclockwise. Both CT and US are useful in making preoperative diagnosis of torsion of the gallbladder. Once the accurate diagnosis is made, early cholecystectomy is necessary to obtain a successful outcome because it is associated with necrosis of the gallbladder.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '胆嚢軸捻転', 'relation': 'の診断に用いられる', 'object': '腹部CTおよび腹部超音波検査（US）'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 胆嚢軸捻転 (torsion of the gallbladder)
- **Relation:** の診断に用いられる (used for diagnosis of)
- **Object:** 腹部CTおよび腹部超音波検査（US） (abdominal CT and abdominal ultrasonography (US))

### English Abstract
Relevant sentences:
> "Computed Tomography (CT) and ultrasonogaphy (US) were performed and she was diagnosed as to have torsion of the gallbladder."
> "CT and US were performed and she was diagnosed as to have torsion of the gallbladder."
> "Both CT and US are useful in making preoperative diagnosis of torsion of the gallbladder."

### Reasoning
The abstract clearly states that CT and US were performed and used to diagnose torsion of the gallbladder in both cases. Furthermore, it explicitly says "Both CT and US are useful in making preoperative diagnosis of torsion of the gallbladder." This matches the Japanese triple directly: CT and US are used for the diagnosis of gallbladder torsion.

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentences
- "Computed Tomography (CT) and ultrasonogaphy (US) were performed and she was diagnosed as to have torsion of the gallbladder."
- "CT and US were performed and she was diagnosed as to have torsion of the gallbladder."
- "Both CT and US are useful in making preoperative diagnosis of torsion of the gallbladder."

**Conclusion:** The knowledge triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract.
