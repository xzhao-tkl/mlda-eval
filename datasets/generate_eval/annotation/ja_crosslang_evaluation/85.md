English abstract: Biomedical adhesives are classified into two types. One is used for hard organization systems, which isapplied to bonding systems for artificial joints and to dental fields. Adhesives of this type are made of acrylicresins mixed with powdered resins and liquid polymers. The other is used for soft organization systems, whichis applied to blood vessels and nerves, etc. Adhesives of this type are made of cyanoacrylate resins, instantquick–drying glues, which are recently used for micro surgeries. Creature-originated fibrin resin systems madefrom blood are also used as medical adhesives.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '血液の止血機能を活用した接着剤', 'relation': 'には', 'object': '血液から抽出したフィブリン成分を活用したものがある'}

## Reasoning

**Japanese triple:**  
- Subject: 血液の止血機能を活用した接着剤 (Adhesives utilizing the hemostatic function of blood)
- Relation: には (there are/among them)
- Object: 血液から抽出したフィブリン成分を活用したものがある (there are those that use fibrin components extracted from blood)

**English abstract:**  
The relevant sentence is:  
"Creature-originated fibrin resin systems made from blood are also used as medical adhesives."

This sentence directly states that medical adhesives exist which use fibrin resin systems made from blood. This matches the Japanese triple, which says that among adhesives utilizing the hemostatic function of blood, there are those that use fibrin components extracted from blood.

## Evaluation

**Score:** 2 (Direct match)

**Supporting sentence:**  
"Creature-originated fibrin resin systems made from blood are also used as medical adhesives."

**Reasoning:**  
The English abstract directly mentions adhesives made from blood-derived fibrin, which matches the Japanese triple's claim about adhesives utilizing blood's hemostatic function and containing fibrin extracted from blood. The correspondence is clear and direct.
