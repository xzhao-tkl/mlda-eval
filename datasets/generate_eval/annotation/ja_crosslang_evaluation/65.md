English abstract: Lipidomics is an important research field that studies lipid species in various experimental materials. The chromatographic separation and detection of lipid species are often carried out by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, but the identification and structural estimation of lipid species are not easy because the available authentic standard compounds and reference mass spectra are limited. This constitutes a major bottleneck in gaining insights into the roles of each of the lipid species involved in biological processes. In order to overcome this problem, artificial (in silico) tandem mass spectral libraries containing a broad range of lipid species have been constructed with the aid of the fragmentation and rearrangement rules of individual lipid classes. Here, we introduce lipid identification tools powered by in silico tandem mass spectral libraries for lipid research.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'リピドミクス', 'relation': 'は研究対象とする学問分野である', 'object': '試料中に含まれる脂質の総体'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** リピドミクス (Lipidomics)
- **Relation:** は研究対象とする学問分野である (is a research field that studies)
- **Object:** 試料中に含まれる脂質の総体 (the total lipids contained in samples / lipid species in experimental materials)

### English Abstract
> Lipidomics is an important research field that studies lipid species in various experimental materials.

### Reasoning
The English abstract **directly states** that "Lipidomics is an important research field that studies lipid species in various experimental materials." This matches the Japanese triple, which says that lipidomics is a research field whose subject is the total lipids in samples.

- **Subject:** Lipidomics
- **Relation:** is a research field that studies
- **Object:** lipid species in various experimental materials

This is a **direct match** to the Japanese triple.

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence(s)
- "Lipidomics is an important research field that studies lipid species in various experimental materials."

### Conclusion
The knowledge triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract.
