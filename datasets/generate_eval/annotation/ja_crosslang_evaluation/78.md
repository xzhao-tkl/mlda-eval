English abstract: Therapeutic management of huge arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the neck and trunk was described according to our experiences. Four patients with AVM were evaluated in this study. Case 1 was of a 24-year-old woman with a huge AVM of the neck who had cardiac failure and syncope. She underwent total resection of the AVM along with the right internal jugular vein, right subclavian artery and vein, right clavicle, right first rib and right hemi-manubrium of the sternum after embolization of the arteries. No recurrence was observed during 7 years after surgery. Case 2 was of a 32-year-old woman with a huge AVM of the neck and back with local pain, bleeding and heat sensation. She underwent sclerotherapy with ethanol. The AVM grew gradually in spite of temporary relief of the symptoms. The remaining two patients were 61 and 55-year-old men with pelvic AVM. They were observed without any treatments for AVM because no symptoms were found except for temporary hematuria. Our results suggested that a complete resection was preferable for symptomatic AVM after appropriate embolization to avoid the progressive deterioration of quality of life. The strategy to manage AVM should be planned by considering pathologies, especially those involving the structures of AVMs, symptoms and patient characteristics.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'AVMの治療', 'relation': 'の目標は', 'object': '塞栓術を併用した全切除術'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** AVMの治療 (Treatment of AVM)
- **Relation:** の目標は (The goal is)
- **Object:** 塞栓術を併用した全切除術 (Complete resection combined with embolization)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Relevant Sentences:
1. "Case 1 was of a 24-year-old woman with a huge AVM of the neck who had cardiac failure and syncope. She underwent total resection of the AVM along with the right internal jugular vein, right subclavian artery and vein, right clavicle, right first rib and right hemi-manubrium of the sternum after embolization of the arteries."
2. "Our results suggested that a complete resection was preferable for symptomatic AVM after appropriate embolization to avoid the progressive deterioration of quality of life."

#### Reasoning:
- The abstract describes a case where the patient underwent **total resection after embolization** ("total resection ... after embolization of the arteries").
- The conclusion states that **complete resection after embolization is preferable for symptomatic AVM** ("a complete resection was preferable for symptomatic AVM after appropriate embolization").
- This matches the Japanese triple, which states that the **goal of AVM treatment is complete resection combined with embolization**.

#### Score Justification:
- The knowledge is **directly expressed** in the abstract, especially in the conclusion sentence.
- The abstract clearly states the treatment goal for symptomatic AVM is complete resection after embolization, which matches the Japanese triple.

### Score: **2** (Direct match)

### Sentences Supporting the Triple:
- "She underwent total resection of the AVM ... after embolization of the arteries."
- "Our results suggested that a complete resection was preferable for symptomatic AVM after appropriate embolization to avoid the progressive deterioration of quality of life."

**Final Evaluation:**  
Score = **2** (Direct match)  
**Supporting sentences:** See above.  
**Reasoning:** The abstract directly states that the goal of AVM treatment is complete resection after embolization, matching the Japanese triple.
