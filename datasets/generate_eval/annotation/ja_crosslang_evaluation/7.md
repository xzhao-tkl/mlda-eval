English abstract: The purpose of this study is to clarify the process of distinct imaging by normal eyes. The device used in the experiment was the improved Harvard Type Tachistoscope, re-modelled by the author to enable free setting of distances. Time till distinct imaging was measured at 5m under 350 lux; Landolt targets were exposed in 100 msec steps (by limiting methods) against each other, from 0.1 to 1.0 (decimal notation) subjects comprised 75 students, 17～21 years of age (naked eyes, 5m distance, all subjects 1.0+ in right and left visual acuity test of school). Eyes below 1.0 visual acuity and the eyes showing exceptional (abnormal) times in the distinct image experiment were excluded from analysis. The following results were obtained:(1) Required time for distinct imaging was 200～300 msec, including all blurred or relatively distinct images.(2) Distinct vision increases as object size decreases relative to visual targets of Landolt, requiring 1,000～1,500 msec in Landolt 1.0 (visual angle 1.0’). This seems to correspond with times of accommodation and fluctuations of accommodateon in daily life vision.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '明視時間', 'relation': 'は視標の縮小に伴い増加し', 'object': '視標1.0（視角1分）では1,000〜1,500 msecを必要とし、日常視における調節時間および調節微動に対応すると推察される'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 明視時間 (Time required for distinct imaging)
- **Relation:** は視標の縮小に伴い増加し (increases as the size of the visual target decreases)
- **Object:** 視標1.0（視角1分）では1,000〜1,500 msecを必要とし、日常視における調節時間および調節微動に対応すると推察される (requires 1,000–1,500 msec for Landolt 1.0 (visual angle 1'), and is thought to correspond to accommodation time and fluctuations in daily vision)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Relevant Sentences:
1. "Distinct vision increases as object size decreases relative to visual targets of Landolt, requiring 1,000～1,500 msec in Landolt 1.0 (visual angle 1.0’)."
2. "This seems to correspond with times of accommodation and fluctuations of accommodateon in daily life vision."

#### Reasoning:
- The first sentence directly states that the time required for distinct vision increases as the object size decreases, and specifically mentions that for Landolt 1.0 (visual angle 1'), the required time is 1,000–1,500 msec.
- The second sentence connects this time requirement to accommodation time and fluctuations in daily life vision, which matches the inference in the Japanese triple.

### Score: **2 (Direct match)**
- The knowledge triple is **clearly and directly expressed** in the English abstract, almost verbatim.

### Sentences Supporting the Triple:
- "Distinct vision increases as object size decreases relative to visual targets of Landolt, requiring 1,000～1,500 msec in Landolt 1.0 (visual angle 1.0’)."
- "This seems to correspond with times of accommodation and fluctuations of accommodateon in daily life vision."

**Final Score:** 2 (Direct match)  
**Supporting Sentences:** See above.  
**Reasoning:** The English abstract directly expresses the same knowledge as the Japanese triple, with no need for inference.
