English abstract: Recent advances in electroneurophysiology (EEG/MEG, Optogenetics) and postmortem studies have revealed that cortical neural oscillation deﬁcit play critical roles in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. A growing body of evidence is accumulating to show that such synchronous oscillations especially within the γband which relates to perception, cognition and consciousness, exhibit deﬁcits in schizophrenia. Impairments in γband oscillation have been hypothesized to arise from disruption of GABAergic inhibitory interneuron one act as a rhythm maker in neural circuit, and excitatory neuron (NMDAR hypofunction), as well as abnormal neuronal balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance). Moreover, these phenomena are believed to be observed across species and can be obtained from animal models of schizophrenia. Thus, γ band oscillation deficit have attracted a lot of attention as a new pathophysiological model of schizophrenia and its therapeutic target.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '皮質の周期的神経活動（neural oscillation）の異常', 'relation': 'は深く関与している', 'object': '精神疾患の病態生理'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 皮質の周期的神経活動（neural oscillation）の異常 (Abnormality of cortical neural oscillation)
- **Relation:** は深く関与している (is deeply involved in)
- **Object:** 精神疾患の病態生理 (pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders)

### English Abstract Analysis

The abstract states:
> "Recent advances in electroneurophysiology (EEG/MEG, Optogenetics) and postmortem studies have revealed that cortical neural oscillation deficit play critical roles in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."

- "cortical neural oscillation deficit" = 皮質の周期的神経活動（neural oscillation）の異常
- "play critical roles in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia" = 精神疾患（specifically schizophrenia）の病態生理に深く関与している

Although the Japanese triple uses the broader term "psychiatric disorders" (精神疾患), the abstract specifically discusses schizophrenia, which is a type of psychiatric disorder. The triple is therefore a generalization of the specific case discussed in the abstract.

### Reasoning

- The abstract **directly states** that deficits in cortical neural oscillations are critically involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
- The Japanese triple generalizes this to "psychiatric disorders," but the core knowledge (abnormal neural oscillations are deeply involved in the pathophysiology) is **directly supported** for schizophrenia.
- The relevant sentence is:  
  > "Recent advances in electroneurophysiology (EEG/MEG, Optogenetics) and postmortem studies have revealed that cortical neural oscillation deficit play critical roles in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence

- "Recent advances in electroneurophysiology (EEG/MEG, Optogenetics) and postmortem studies have revealed that cortical neural oscillation deficit play critical roles in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."

### Summary

The knowledge triple is directly supported by the abstract, with the only difference being that the triple generalizes to "psychiatric disorders" while the abstract focuses on schizophrenia. Since schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder, the triple is a direct match.
