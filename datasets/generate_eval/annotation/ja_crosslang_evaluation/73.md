English abstract: Wolf and Bowers  (1999)  proposed the double-deficit hypothesis of developmental dyslexia in which, in addition to phonological deficit, they put forward naming speed deficit as a second core factor of developmental dyslexia.  They also reported the double deficit group showing both phonological and naming speed deficits manifested in the most severe reading difficulty.  In this study, we investigated the adaptation of the double-deficit hypothesis to 94 Japanese third grade children attending public school.  For the sake of comparisons with foreign studies, we used the same criteria as Sunseth and Bowers  (2002)  for English speakers and the same as Wimmer et al  (2000)  for German-speaking third graders.  The results indicated that, for both sets of criteria, Japanese-speaking children can be classified into three subgroups based on the double-deficit hypothesis.  However, the double deficit group was not the most severe group in all tasks.  Our findings suggest that the double-deficit hypothesis applies only partly in the case of Japanese third grade children.

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 二重障害仮説（Wolf and Bowers, 1999） (Double-deficit hypothesis (Wolf and Bowers, 1999))
- **Relation:** は発達性読み書き障害の原因となる認知障害として重要であるとする (proposes as important cognitive deficits causing developmental dyslexia)
- **Object:** 音韻認識障害に加えて呼称速度障害 (in addition to phonological deficit, naming speed deficit)

### English Abstract
The relevant part of the abstract is:
> Wolf and Bowers (1999) proposed the double-deficit hypothesis of developmental dyslexia in which, in addition to phonological deficit, they put forward naming speed deficit as a second core factor of developmental dyslexia.

### Reasoning
- The Japanese triple states that the double-deficit hypothesis (Wolf and Bowers, 1999) proposes that, in addition to phonological deficit, naming speed deficit is an important cognitive deficit causing developmental dyslexia.
- The English abstract directly states that Wolf and Bowers (1999) proposed the double-deficit hypothesis of developmental dyslexia, in which, in addition to phonological deficit, naming speed deficit is put forward as a second core factor of developmental dyslexia.

This is a **direct match**: the same knowledge is clearly expressed in one sentence in the English abstract.

### Score
**Score = 2**

### Supporting Sentence(s)
> "Wolf and Bowers (1999) proposed the double-deficit hypothesis of developmental dyslexia in which, in addition to phonological deficit, they put forward naming speed deficit as a second core factor of developmental dyslexia."

### Summary
The Japanese triple is directly supported by the English abstract, as the same knowledge is clearly and explicitly stated.
