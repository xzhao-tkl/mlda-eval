English abstract: We analyzed the quality of the groundwater for irrigation at the Mibu plateau which is the most active region for cultivation of upland crops in Tochigi Prefecture. Our results showed that although the concentration of nitrate nitrogen in the groundwater did not exceed the environmental standard (10 mg L-1), the concentration was higher than that in other areas in Tochigi prefecture. The results obtained from the experiments using the δ15N value method and the land use history suggested that the chemical fertilizer greatly influenced the water quality of the groundwater. In a different experiment, the yield of bottle gourd and the leaching of nitrogen from the soil in the plots that had been treated with standard fertilizer were compared with those in the plots that had been treated with heavy fertilizer. The yield of bottle gourd in the heavy fertilizer-treated plots was 10% higher than that in the standard fertilizer-treated plots. From the viewpoint of cost performance, heavy fertilization had no economic advantage because the increase in income from the high yield was equivalent to the increase in cost for fertilizer. The percentage of leached fertilizer nitrogen was 19.6% in the standard fertilizer-treated plot and 39.6% in the heavy fertilizer-treated plot. Crop cultivation using heavy fertilizer is considered to be the cause of the pollution of groundwater with nitrogen.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '多肥栽培', 'relation': 'は', 'object': '地下水の硝酸態窒素濃度の上昇に影響を与える可能性がある'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 多肥栽培 (heavy fertilization/cultivation with heavy fertilizer)
- Relation: は (topic marker, "is"/"has")
- Object: 地下水の硝酸態窒素濃度の上昇に影響を与える可能性がある (may influence/increase the concentration of nitrate nitrogen in groundwater)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Relevant Sentences:
1. "The results obtained from the experiments using the δ15N value method and the land use history suggested that the chemical fertilizer greatly influenced the water quality of the groundwater."
2. "Crop cultivation using heavy fertilizer is considered to be the cause of the pollution of groundwater with nitrogen."

#### Reasoning:
- The Japanese triple states that heavy fertilization may influence/increase the nitrate nitrogen concentration in groundwater.
- The English abstract directly states that "Crop cultivation using heavy fertilizer is considered to be the cause of the pollution of groundwater with nitrogen." This is a direct match to the triple, as it explicitly links heavy fertilizer use to groundwater nitrogen pollution (which is typically in the form of nitrate nitrogen).
- Additionally, the abstract mentions that chemical fertilizer greatly influenced groundwater quality, supporting the connection.

### Score: **2 (Direct match)**

#### Supporting Sentences:
- "Crop cultivation using heavy fertilizer is considered to be the cause of the pollution of groundwater with nitrogen."
- "The results obtained from the experiments using the δ15N value method and the land use history suggested that the chemical fertilizer greatly influenced the water quality of the groundwater."

### Conclusion:
The knowledge triple is directly supported by the English abstract, with explicit statements linking heavy fertilization to increased nitrogen (nitrate) pollution in groundwater.
