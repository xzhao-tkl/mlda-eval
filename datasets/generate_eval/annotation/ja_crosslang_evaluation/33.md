English abstract: The vascular system of a rat mammary tumor, fibroadenoma, was investigated by scanning electron microscopy of resin casts. The present research was designed to provide a three-dimensional presentation of the tumor vasculature and its capillary circulation. Arterial injections of methyl methacrylate were made through the left ventricle to prepare the corrosion casts. The principal sources of blood to the tumor at the breast and inguinal region were the lateral thoracic and caudal superficial epigastric arteries, respectively. These vessels entwined the tumor, establishing irregular vascular conglomerations over its entire surface. The main vessels to the tumor were always straight and greatly enlarged just before and after they entered the tumor. The main trunks of the tumor vascular vessels lacked intraarterial cushions, which regulate blood flow at branching sites. The capillary network consisted of a plexus of fine capillaries with no resemblance to the differentiated vascular system. Two types of capillaries were present in the network: those that were thin with a luminal diameter of 5-12μm and formed a coarse capillary plexus, possibly the fibrous part, and those that were thick with sinusoidal dilations ranging 40-50μm in diameter and formed a densely packed capillary network, possibly the glandular part.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '細い血管 (5~12μm)', 'relation': 'は主に分布している', 'object': '腫瘍内の線維部'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 細い血管 (5~12μm) [Thin capillaries (5–12μm)]
- **Relation:** は主に分布している [are mainly distributed]
- **Object:** 腫瘍内の線維部 [in the fibrous part of the tumor]

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant sentence(s):
> "Two types of capillaries were present in the network: those that were thin with a luminal diameter of 5-12μm and formed a coarse capillary plexus, possibly the fibrous part, and those that were thick with sinusoidal dilations ranging 40-50μm in diameter and formed a densely packed capillary network, possibly the glandular part."

#### Reasoning

- The abstract describes two types of capillaries in the tumor:
  - Thin capillaries (5–12μm) form a coarse capillary plexus, **possibly the fibrous part**.
  - Thick capillaries (40–50μm) form a densely packed network, **possibly the glandular part**.
- The Japanese triple states that thin capillaries (5–12μm) are mainly distributed in the fibrous part of the tumor.
- The English abstract does not state this as a direct fact, but says "possibly the fibrous part," indicating a strong inference but not a definitive statement.

#### Score Assignment

- **Score = 1: Inferable**
  - The triple is not directly stated as a fact, but the information in the abstract allows a reasonable inference that the thin capillaries are mainly distributed in the fibrous part of the tumor.

#### Supporting Sentence(s)

- "Two types of capillaries were present in the network: those that were thin with a luminal diameter of 5-12μm and formed a coarse capillary plexus, possibly the fibrous part..."
