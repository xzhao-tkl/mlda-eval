English abstract: To screen Lynch syndrome (LS), family history taking is an important element. However, in the patient of early colorectal cancer who could be treated by endoscopically procedures, generally endoscopists do not enough list medical history or detailed family history. Herein we report a 60-year-old woman who suspected LS by her family history before treatment and genetic testing. She was referred to our hospital to receive treatment for rectal cancer diagnosed at a local clinic. After our precise family history taking, we found that her family history was fulfilled both the Amsterdam criteria II and revised Bethesda guidelines. Curative resection was performed by endoscopic submucosal dissection, and the lesion was diagnosed as a carcinoma in situ. After genetic counseling, she agreed with analyses for germline mutations and then we found a pathogenic variant in the mismatch repair gene, MSH2. The case we experienced tell us that clinicians, especially endoscopists, had better pay more attention to family history taking.

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 早期直腸癌の段階でリンチ症候群を診断すること  
  (Diagnosing Lynch syndrome at the early rectal cancer stage)
- **Relation:** は  
  (is/does)
- **Object:** 関連癌のサーベイランスの早期開始と患者への大きな利益をもたらす  
  (brings early initiation of surveillance for related cancers and great benefit to the patient)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Reasoning
The abstract describes a case where Lynch syndrome (LS) was suspected and diagnosed in a patient with early-stage rectal cancer, based on family history and genetic testing. It details that:
- The patient was diagnosed with rectal cancer at an early stage.
- Family history was carefully taken, leading to suspicion and confirmation of LS.
- The diagnosis led to curative treatment and genetic counseling.
- The abstract emphasizes the importance of family history for LS screening, especially in early colorectal cancer cases.

However, the abstract does **not** explicitly state that diagnosing LS at the early rectal cancer stage leads to "early initiation of surveillance for related cancers" or "great benefit to the patient." It implies that early diagnosis is important and beneficial, but does not directly mention surveillance or enumerate specific benefits.

#### Sentence Identification
- The closest relevant sentences are:
  - "To screen Lynch syndrome (LS), family history taking is an important element."
  - "The case we experienced tell us that clinicians, especially endoscopists, had better pay more attention to family history taking."
  - "After genetic counseling, she agreed with analyses for germline mutations and then we found a pathogenic variant in the mismatch repair gene, MSH2."

These sentences support the importance of early diagnosis, but do **not** directly state the triple's object (early surveillance and great benefit).

### Score

**Score = 1: Inferable**

- The abstract allows us to infer that early diagnosis of LS in early rectal cancer is beneficial to the patient, as it leads to appropriate genetic counseling and treatment. However, the specific point about "early initiation of surveillance for related cancers" and "great benefit" is not directly stated, but can be reasonably inferred as the motivation behind early diagnosis and genetic counseling.

#### Supporting Sentences
- "Herein we report a 60-year-old woman who suspected LS by her family history before treatment and genetic testing."
- "The case we experienced tell us that clinicians, especially endoscopists, had better pay more attention to family history taking."

### Final Evaluation

- **Score:** 1 (Inferable)
- **Reasoning:** The abstract supports the idea that early diagnosis of LS in early rectal cancer is beneficial, but does not directly mention early surveillance or enumerate the benefits. The knowledge can be reasonably inferred from the context.
