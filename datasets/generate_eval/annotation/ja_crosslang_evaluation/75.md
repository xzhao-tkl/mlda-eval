English abstract: Almost all symptoms of diabetic gangrene have so far been noted in the lower extremities. Their occurrence in the upper extremities is reported to be very rare. Recently, however, we treated one diabetic patient who had a spot of gangrene in the finger. The patient, a 50-year-old male, has suffered from diabetes for the last 7 years. He has been treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for the last 2 years, since.July 1977. In August, 1977, when gangrene first occurred, he was injured slightly in the fourth toe of the left foot, but it was soon cured. A year later, in August, 1978, a rose thorn pierced and entered the tip of the fourth finger of the right hand, and gangrene again appeared. Angiography revealed complete obstruction at the ulnar artery, with blood flow to the fourth and fifth fingers supplied by collateral flow through the interosseous and radial arteries. Burger's disease was suspected because of the patient's smoking history, the regions in which the symptoms occurred, and rather deficient angiographic findings for atherosclerotic lesions. However, there was a background of diabetic microangiopathy and neuropathy, and the patient was diagnosed as diabetic gangrene based on the manner of cure and reduction of pain through the use of insulin, although the patient continued smoking, and the fact that the gangrene had been triggered by a wound, and spot-like findings were obtained by thermography. A switch was made from oral hypoglycemic agents to insulin injection, performed in combination with local insulin pack therapy. Antibiotics and peripheral vasodilators were also administered concomitantly. About 6 months later, in January, 1979, the gangrene was cured, and no relapse had occurred as of June, 1979.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '糖尿病性壊疽', 'relation': 'は', 'object': 'そのほとんどが下肢に発生し、上肢に発生するものは極めて稀である'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 糖尿病性壊疽 (diabetic gangrene)
- Relation: は (is/has)
- Object: そのほとんどが下肢に発生し、上肢に発生するものは極めて稀である (almost all occur in the lower extremities, and occurrence in the upper extremities is extremely rare)

### English Abstract
**Relevant sentences:**
1. "Almost all symptoms of diabetic gangrene have so far been noted in the lower extremities. Their occurrence in the upper extremities is reported to be very rare."

### Reasoning
The English abstract directly states that almost all cases of diabetic gangrene are found in the lower extremities, and that it is very rare in the upper extremities. This matches the Japanese triple exactly, both in subject (diabetic gangrene), relation (occurrence), and object (mostly lower extremities, very rare in upper extremities).

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentences
- "Almost all symptoms of diabetic gangrene have so far been noted in the lower extremities. Their occurrence in the upper extremities is reported to be very rare."

**These two sentences directly express the knowledge in the Japanese triple.**
