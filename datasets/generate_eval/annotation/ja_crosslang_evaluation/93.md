English abstract: We evaluated diagnostic capability and clinical usefulness of histological diagnosis of the pancreas by percutaneous biopsy controled on ultrasound image. Thirty seven patients with pancreas carcinoma and 11 with chronic pancreatitis underwent the procedure using 21 gauge-Sonopsy C1needle (Hakko co. Ltd.). Specimens of the tissue obtained were adequate for histological interpretation in 95.8% of all the 48 patients. The histological judgement referring to the nature of the lesion corresponded in 91.3% with the final diagnosis established surgical exploration, autopsy or long follow up more than one year. In cases of pancreas carcinoma with a successful procedure of the biopsy, histological type of carcinoma was confirmed in 91.4% of the tumors. It proved accordant pathologically with the conclusion based on the resected tumors in 5 of 8 patients operated on after the biopsy. Chronic pancreatitis was histologically diagnosed in 9 of the 11 patients with the biopsy. A confident diagnosis could not be obtained by imaging modalities including ultrasound, X-ray CT, ERCP and angiography in 7 of 37 patients with pancreas carcinoma and 3 of 11 with chronic pancreatitis. Biopsy by this method was so useful as to obtain the correct diagnosis in all these cases but one. Abdominal pain happend most frequently as a adverse effect during the procedure, but dissapered soon after that. There were no serious complications requiring intensive care. In conclusion, percutaneous histological biopsy controlled on ultrasound image may be recommended as a reliable method for making a definite diagnosis providing more valuable information than cytological biopsy, when diagnostic imaging modalities are unsuccessful in elucidating patholoy of the pancreas.

- **Relation:** は (has/is)
- **Object:** 細胞診に優る診断能を有し、安全で膵疾患の診断に有用である (has superior diagnostic capability compared to cytological diagnosis, is safe, and is useful for diagnosing pancreatic diseases)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Key Points from the Abstract:
1. **Diagnostic Capability:**  
   - "Percutaneous biopsy controlled on ultrasound image... Specimens of the tissue obtained were adequate for histological interpretation in 95.8% of all the 48 patients."
   - "The histological judgement referring to the nature of the lesion corresponded in 91.3% with the final diagnosis..."
   - "In conclusion, percutaneous histological biopsy controlled on ultrasound image may be recommended as a reliable method for making a definite diagnosis providing more valuable information than cytological biopsy, when diagnostic imaging modalities are unsuccessful in elucidating pathology of the pancreas."

2. **Comparison to Cytological Biopsy:**  
   - "providing more valuable information than cytological biopsy"

3. **Safety:**  
   - "Abdominal pain happened most frequently as an adverse effect during the procedure, but disappeared soon after that. There were no serious complications requiring intensive care."

4. **Usefulness for Pancreatic Disease Diagnosis:**  
   - "may be recommended as a reliable method for making a definite diagnosis... when diagnostic imaging modalities are unsuccessful in elucidating pathology of the pancreas."

#### Reasoning

- The abstract **directly states** that percutaneous histological biopsy provides more valuable information than cytological biopsy, which matches "細胞診に優る診断能".
- The abstract **explicitly mentions safety**, noting only mild, transient adverse effects and no serious complications, matching "安全".
- The abstract **clearly supports usefulness for pancreatic disease diagnosis**, as it is recommended when other modalities fail, matching "膵疾患の診断に有用".

#### Sentence Identification

- **Direct match sentence:**  
  "In conclusion, percutaneous histological biopsy controlled on ultrasound image may be recommended as a reliable method for making a definite diagnosis providing more valuable information than cytological biopsy, when diagnostic imaging modalities are unsuccessful in elucidating pathology of the pancreas."
- **Safety:**  
  "Abdominal pain happened most frequently as an adverse effect during the procedure, but disappeared soon after that. There were no serious complications requiring intensive care."

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**  
- The triple is clearly and directly supported by the abstract, with explicit statements about superior diagnostic capability, safety, and usefulness for pancreatic disease diagnosis.

### Supporting Sentences
