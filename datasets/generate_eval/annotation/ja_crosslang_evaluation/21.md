English abstract: The brain is a fatty organ rich in various lipid molecules that consist approximately 60 % of its dry weight, and docosahexanoic acid and arachidonic acid are the most major polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). These PUFAs are known as essential fatty acids and pivotal in brain development of infants. They are also reported to improve learning and memory in dementia and to ameliorate schizophrenic symptoms. The PUFAs are specifically bound to fatty acid binding proteins (Fabps) in the cytoplasm, and transported to the cell membrane and work as ligands for nuclear receptor transcription factors. In this article, I would like to introduce involvement of PUFAs and Fabps in neurogenesis in views of neurobiology and behavioral neuroscience.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'PUFA（多価不飽和脂肪酸）', 'relation': 'は細胞質内で特異的に結合し、細胞膜への輸送や遺伝子発現に関与する', 'object': '脂肪酸結合タンパク質（Fabp）'}

## Evaluation of Cross-lingual Correctness

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** PUFA（多価不飽和脂肪酸） (PUFAs)
- **Relation:** は細胞質内で特異的に結合し、細胞膜への輸送や遺伝子発現に関与する (specifically bind in the cytoplasm, are transported to the cell membrane, and are involved in gene expression)
- **Object:** 脂肪酸結合タンパク質（Fabp） (fatty acid binding proteins, Fabps)

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant sentences:
> The PUFAs are specifically bound to fatty acid binding proteins (Fabps) in the cytoplasm, and transported to the cell membrane and work as ligands for nuclear receptor transcription factors.

#### Reasoning

- The abstract directly states that PUFAs are "specifically bound to fatty acid binding proteins (Fabps) in the cytoplasm," which matches the first part of the Japanese triple.
- It continues: "and transported to the cell membrane," which matches the second part.
- Finally, "work as ligands for nuclear receptor transcription factors" implies involvement in gene expression, which matches the third part of the Japanese triple.

All elements of the Japanese triple are directly and clearly expressed in one sentence in the English abstract.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence(s)

> "The PUFAs are specifically bound to fatty acid binding proteins (Fabps) in the cytoplasm, and transported to the cell membrane and work as ligands for nuclear receptor transcription factors."

---

**Summary:**  
The knowledge triple is directly and fully supported by the English abstract, with all elements present in a single sentence.
