English abstract: Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is still one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in hematological patients, although its outcome has been improving. Prolonged and profound neutropenia in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia and stem cell transplantation is a major risk factor for IA. Allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients with graft-versus-host disease and corticosteroid use are also at high risk. Management in a protective environment with high efficiency particular air (HEPA) filter is generally recommended to prevent aspergillosis in patients with prolonged and profound neutropenia. Antifungal prophylaxis against Aspergillus species should be considered in patients with past history of aspergillosis or colonization of Aspergillus species, at facilities with high incidence of IA and those without a protective environment. Early diagnosis and prompt antifungal treatment is important to improve outcome. Imaging studies such as computed tomography and biomarkers such as galactomannan antigen and β-D-glucan are useful for early diagnosis. Empirical antifungal treatment based on persistent or recurrent fever during neutropenia despite broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is generally recommended in high-risk patients. Alternatively, a preemptive treatment strategy has recently been proposed in the context of progress in the early diagnosis of IA based on the results of imaging studies and biomarkers. Voriconazole is recommended for initial therapy for IA. Liposomal amphotericin B is considered as alternative initial therapy. Combination antifungal therapy of echinocandin with voriconazole or liposomal amphotericin B could be a choice for refractory cases.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'IAの標的治療', 'relation': 'で第一選択薬は', 'object': 'ボリコナゾール'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: IAの標的治療 (Targeted therapy for IA)
- Relation: で第一選択薬は (the first choice drug is)
- Object: ボリコナゾール (Voriconazole)

### English Abstract Analysis

We need to check if the abstract directly states or allows us to infer that "Voriconazole is the first choice drug for targeted therapy of IA (invasive aspergillosis)."

#### Relevant Sentence(s)
- "Voriconazole is recommended for initial therapy for IA."

#### Reasoning

- The abstract clearly states that "Voriconazole is recommended for initial therapy for IA."  
- "Initial therapy" in the context of medical treatment is equivalent to "first choice drug" or "first-line therapy."
- The subject "IAの標的治療" (targeted therapy for IA) matches the context of "initial therapy for IA" in the abstract.
- The object "ボリコナゾール" (Voriconazole) is directly mentioned as the recommended drug.

#### Sentence Identification
- The sentence: "Voriconazole is recommended for initial therapy for IA." directly expresses the triple.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match — same triple is clearly expressed in one sentence in the abstract.**

### Supporting Sentence

- "Voriconazole is recommended for initial therapy for IA."

---

**Final Evaluation:**  
Score: **2**  
Supporting sentence: "Voriconazole is recommended for initial therapy for IA."  
Reasoning: The English abstract directly states that Voriconazole is the recommended initial therapy for IA, which matches the Japanese triple about the first choice drug for targeted therapy of IA.
