English abstract: Eight operation speciemens of human hepatocellular carcinoma were examined electron microscopically with much attention to the fine structure of those blood spaces. Small gaps or fenestrations of endothelial lining cells of tumor vessels were found with difficulty but the appearance of intercellular junctions between these cells were commomly observed. Basement membrane-like substances were seen beneath the endothelial cells in continuous or discontinuous fashion. Cytoplasmic folds were developed, forming marginal folds at the junctions, and cytoplasmic organelles of endothelial cells, such as the rER, mitochondria, and pinocytotic vesicles, were prominent. These observations could represent findings of active transport of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells which were covered by pericytes or having cytoplasmic filaments in those cytoplasms were also seen. Subendothelial space contained moderate to many microvilli extended from hepatoma cells. All these ultrastructural alterations of blood spaces were differed from the normal fine structure of sinusoid.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '内皮細胞', 'relation': 'には', 'object': '細胞質ヒダの発達、marginal foldの形成、pinocytotic vesiclesの多さ、rERやミトコンドリアなどの細胞内小器官の発達、活発な能動輸送'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 内皮細胞 (Endothelial cells)
- **Relation:** には (have/possess)
- **Object:** 細胞質ヒダの発達、marginal foldの形成、pinocytotic vesiclesの多さ、rERやミトコンドリアなどの細胞内小器官の発達、活発な能動輸送  
  (Development of cytoplasmic folds, formation of marginal folds, abundance of pinocytotic vesicles, development of intracellular organelles such as rER and mitochondria, active transport)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Relevant Sentences:
1. "Cytoplasmic folds were developed, forming marginal folds at the junctions, and cytoplasmic organelles of endothelial cells, such as the rER, mitochondria, and pinocytotic vesicles, were prominent."
2. "These observations could represent findings of active transport of endothelial cells."

#### Reasoning:
- The first sentence directly describes the development of cytoplasmic folds, formation of marginal folds, and the prominence (abundance/development) of pinocytotic vesicles, rER, and mitochondria in endothelial cells.
- The second sentence infers that these structural features are associated with active transport in endothelial cells.

All elements of the Japanese triple (subject, relation, object) are directly and clearly expressed in the English abstract, specifically in the sentences above.

### Score: **2 (Direct match)**

#### Sentences Identified:
- "Cytoplasmic folds were developed, forming marginal folds at the junctions, and cytoplasmic organelles of endothelial cells, such as the rER, mitochondria, and pinocytotic vesicles, were prominent."
- "These observations could represent findings of active transport of endothelial cells."

### Conclusion
The knowledge triple is directly supported by the English abstract, with all components clearly described in one or two consecutive sentences.
