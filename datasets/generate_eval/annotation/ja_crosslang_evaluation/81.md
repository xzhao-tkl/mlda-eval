English abstract: We experienced two cases of colorectal cancer with multiple liver metastases in which microwave coagulation therapy (MCT) and hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) chemotherapy brought a complete remission.  A 38-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for advanced cancer of the sigmoid colon with synchronous multiple liver metastases. He underwent a sigmoidectomy with regional lymph node dissection (D3) and MCT for liver metastases on December 15, 1997. HAI of 5-FU (250mg/day as a continuous 24-hour infusion for 28 days) was undertaken on 15POD. After discharge from the hospital, HAI of 5-FU (750-1000mg/1-2 week as a 5-hour infusion) was continued. Four months after the operation, serum CEA and CA19-9 were decreased within normal ranges. He has been free from any signs of recurrence as of 34 months after the operation.  A 50-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for early rectal cancer. Multiple metastatic lesions in the bilateral lobes of liver were found in further examinations. He underwent a low anterior resection (D2), and MCT for liver metastases on June 22, 1999. After the operation, HAI of 5-FU was performed. He has been free from any signs of recurrence as of 16 months after the operation.  This combination therapy of MCT and HAI is one of effective treatments, and improves the quality of life in patients with synchronous multiple liver metastases.
