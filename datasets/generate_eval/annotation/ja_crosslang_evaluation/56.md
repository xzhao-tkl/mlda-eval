English abstract: Acute colorectal obstruction is a common complication of advanced colorectal carcinoma that necessi tates an emergency operation. However, because of colonic distension, fecal loading, and the poor general condition caused by colorectal obstructions, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates are high. Decompression using a transanal drainage tube is useful for avoiding an emergency operation or allowing a safe onestage operation to be performed. The use of a drainage tube is superior to that of an expandable metallic stent, from both a clinical and cost perspective, for preoperative therapy of acute colonic obstruc tion.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '閉塞性大腸癌', 'relation': 'は', 'object': '癌を切除する前に緊急減圧処置を必要とする腫瘍学的救急疾患（oncologic emergency）の一つ'}

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the Japanese triple:**
   - Subject: 閉塞性大腸癌 (obstructive colorectal cancer)
   - Relation: は (is)
   - Object: 癌を切除する前に緊急減圧処置を必要とする腫瘍学的救急疾患（oncologic emergency）の一つ (one of the oncologic emergencies that requires urgent decompression before cancer resection)

2. **Understanding the English abstract:**
   - Acute colorectal obstruction is a common complication of advanced colorectal carcinoma that necessitates an emergency operation.
   - Because of the obstruction, there are high postoperative risks.
   - Decompression using a transanal drainage tube is useful for avoiding emergency operation or allowing a safe one-stage operation.
   - Drainage tube is superior to metallic stent for preoperative therapy of acute colonic obstruction.

3. **Matching the knowledge:**
   - The abstract states that acute colorectal obstruction (which is caused by advanced colorectal carcinoma) "necessitates an emergency operation."
   - It also discusses "decompression using a transanal drainage tube" as a preoperative therapy, implying that urgent decompression is needed before resection.
   - The abstract refers to the situation as an emergency and describes the need for urgent intervention before definitive cancer surgery.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - The triple says: Obstructive colorectal cancer is an oncologic emergency that requires urgent decompression before cancer resection.
   - The abstract says: Acute colorectal obstruction (from cancer) is an emergency that requires urgent decompression before surgery.

**Score: 2 (Direct match)**

**Supporting sentences:**
- "Acute colorectal obstruction is a common complication of advanced colorectal carcinoma that necessitates an emergency operation."
- "Decompression using a transanal drainage tube is useful for avoiding an emergency operation or allowing a safe onestage operation to be performed."
- "The use of a drainage tube is superior to that of an expandable metallic stent, from both a clinical and cost perspective, for preoperative therapy of acute colonic obstruction."

**Reasoning:**  
The abstract directly states that acute colorectal obstruction (caused by cancer) is an emergency and that urgent decompression is needed before surgery, which matches the Japanese triple. The concept of "oncologic emergency" and "urgent decompression before resection" is clearly expressed.
