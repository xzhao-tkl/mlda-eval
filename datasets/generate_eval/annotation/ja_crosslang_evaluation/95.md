English abstract: Background. In the present study, we report two cases of gastric metastasis arising from lung cancer treated with gastrectomy. Cases. Case 1 involved a woman in her 60's diagnosed with lung cancer and who subsequently underwent left upper lobectomy. A three-month follow-up period with computed tomography revealed a gastric tumor, and gastroendoscopic images showed a submucosal tumor. We diagnosed the patient with primary gastric cancer and performed total gastrectomy; however, the pathological findings showed metastatic adenocarcinoma arising from lung cancer. Furthermore, after three months, multiple liver metastases appeared, which were treated with chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the liver tumors proliferated, and the patient died three months postoperatively. Case 2 involved a man in his 70's who had been diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent left lower lobectomy and lingulectomy. Two years after the surgery, he was admitted for gastrointestinal hemorrhage resulting from gastric cancer. We then performed completion gastrectomy to cure the hemorrhage, and the patient was diagnosed as having metastatic growth from lung cancer. However, he died six months after gastrectomy. Conclusions. In lung cancer patients who complain of digestive symptoms, physicians should perform endoscopy and search for any possible metastasis of lung cancer according to the characteristic findings.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '残胃全摘術', 'relation': 'は出血コントロール目的で施行され', 'object': '病理検査で肺癌の胃転移と診断された'}

## Reasoning

Let's break down the Japanese triple:

- **Subject:** 残胃全摘術 (completion gastrectomy)
- **Relation:** は出血コントロール目的で施行され (was performed for the purpose of controlling hemorrhage)
- **Object:** 病理検査で肺癌の胃転移と診断された (diagnosed as gastric metastasis from lung cancer by pathological examination)

So, the triple says: "Completion gastrectomy was performed for hemorrhage control, and pathological examination diagnosed gastric metastasis from lung cancer."

Now, let's look for this information in the English abstract, focusing on Case 2:

> Case 2 involved a man in his 70's who had been diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent left lower lobectomy and lingulectomy. Two years after the surgery, he was admitted for gastrointestinal hemorrhage resulting from gastric cancer. We then performed completion gastrectomy to cure the hemorrhage, and the patient was diagnosed as having metastatic growth from lung cancer. However, he died six months after gastrectomy.

### Step-by-step mapping:

- **Completion gastrectomy performed for hemorrhage control:**  
  "We then performed completion gastrectomy to cure the hemorrhage"  
  (Direct match to the subject and relation)

- **Diagnosed as gastric metastasis from lung cancer by pathology:**  
  "the patient was diagnosed as having metastatic growth from lung cancer"  
  (Direct match to the object)

### Sentence identification

The relevant sentences are:

> "Two years after the surgery, he was admitted for gastrointestinal hemorrhage resulting from gastric cancer. We then performed completion gastrectomy to cure the hemorrhage, and the patient was diagnosed as having metastatic growth from lung cancer."

## Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

The triple is clearly and directly expressed in the English abstract, specifically in the sentences above.

## Final Answer

**Score: 2**

**Sentences supporting the triple:**
- "We then performed completion gastrectomy to cure the hemorrhage, and the patient was diagnosed as having metastatic growth from lung cancer."

**Reasoning:**  
The English abstract directly states that completion gastrectomy was performed to control hemorrhage, and the diagnosis was gastric metastasis from lung cancer, matching the Japanese triple exactly.
