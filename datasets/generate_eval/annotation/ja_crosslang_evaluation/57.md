English abstract: A 49-year-old woman visited our hospital because upon screening, PET imaging showed increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the pancreas tail. CT scan and MR imaging revealed a 1cm solid tumor mass in the pancreas tail. No cysts or calcifications were identified. Serum levels of tumor markers and endocrine hormones were within normal levels. We performed distal pancreatectomy because of suspicious pancreatic cancer. On histological examination, we identified small and uniform tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm having a solid growth pattern. Immunohistochemical staining showed that tumor cells were positive for α1-antitrypsin, CD10, NSE and CD56, and negative for synaptophysin and Chromogranin A. We diagnosed this case as a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN). A small SPN having no calcification or cyst is difficult to distinguish from pancreatic cancer. Since small SPN can have a high uptake of FDG, PET imaging is not useful for the differential diagnosis from pancreatic cancer.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'PETで高集積する小さな膵腫瘍', 'relation': 'の鑑別診断として考慮すべきなのは', 'object': 'SPN（膵腫瘍性膵腫瘍）'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** PETで高集積する小さな膵腫瘍 (Small pancreatic tumor with high uptake on PET)
- **Relation:** の鑑別診断として考慮すべきなのは (should be considered in the differential diagnosis)
- **Object:** SPN（膵腫瘍性膵腫瘍） (SPN: solid pseudopapillary neoplasm)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Relevant Information:
- "A 49-year-old woman visited our hospital because upon screening, PET imaging showed increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the pancreas tail."
- "CT scan and MR imaging revealed a 1cm solid tumor mass in the pancreas tail."
- "We diagnosed this case as a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN)."
- "A small SPN having no calcification or cyst is difficult to distinguish from pancreatic cancer."
- "Since small SPN can have a high uptake of FDG, PET imaging is not useful for the differential diagnosis from pancreatic cancer."

#### Reasoning:
The abstract describes a case where a small pancreatic tumor with high FDG uptake on PET was ultimately diagnosed as SPN. It further discusses the difficulty in distinguishing small SPN from pancreatic cancer based on PET imaging, and explicitly states that small SPN can show high FDG uptake. The abstract thus supports the knowledge that SPN should be considered in the differential diagnosis of small pancreatic tumors with high PET uptake.

#### Sentence(s) Supporting the Triple:
- "Since small SPN can have a high uptake of FDG, PET imaging is not useful for the differential diagnosis from pancreatic cancer."
- "We diagnosed this case as a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN)."
- "A small SPN having no calcification or cyst is difficult to distinguish from pancreatic cancer."

### Score: **2 (Direct match)**
- The knowledge triple is directly and clearly expressed in the abstract: small pancreatic tumors with high PET uptake should include SPN in the differential diagnosis.

### Supporting Sentences:
- "Since small SPN can have a high uptake of FDG, PET imaging is not useful for the differential diagnosis from pancreatic cancer."
- "We diagnosed this case as a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN)."
- "A small SPN having no calcification or cyst is difficult to distinguish from pancreatic cancer."

**Conclusion:**  
Score = **2**. The triple is directly supported by the abstract.
