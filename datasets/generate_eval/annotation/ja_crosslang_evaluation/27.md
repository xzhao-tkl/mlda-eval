English abstract: Phytic acid (myo-inositol hexaphosphoric acid, IP6) has the ability to chelate minerals because of its reactive phosphate groups attached to the inositol ring. Most published reports on phytic acid have focused on possible decreased mineral absorption due to its ability to chelate divalent cations. On the other hand, a number of studies have shown that myo-inositol functions as a lipotropic factor. We have shown that, in addition to dietary myo-inositol, dietary phytic acid reduces excessive hepatic triglyceride. Many studies by other groups have also shown that phytic acid and myo-inositol have anticancer activity. Some researchers have recently demonstrated that phytic acid is present as an intracellular molecule in mammalian cells, and has a number of physiological functions such as vesicle trafficking and cell signaling. These properties suggest that phytic acid might function as a vitamin-like substance. We should therefore consider that phytic acid could be involved in various biological roles.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'フィチン酸', 'relation': 'は有する', 'object': '抗脂肪肝作用'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: フィチン酸 (Phytic acid)
- Relation: は有する (has/possesses)
- Object: 抗脂肪肝作用 (anti-fatty liver effect / activity against fatty liver)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Relevant Sentences:
- "We have shown that, in addition to dietary myo-inositol, dietary phytic acid reduces excessive hepatic triglyceride."
- "Many studies by other groups have also shown that phytic acid and myo-inositol have anticancer activity."

#### Reasoning:
The key part of the triple is "phytic acid has anti-fatty liver effect." In the abstract, the sentence "dietary phytic acid reduces excessive hepatic triglyceride" directly supports this. Excessive hepatic triglyceride is a hallmark of fatty liver (hepatic steatosis), and a substance that reduces it is considered to have an anti-fatty liver effect. Therefore, the knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly expressed in the English abstract.

#### Score Justification:
- **Score = 2 (Direct match):** The triple is clearly expressed in one sentence: "dietary phytic acid reduces excessive hepatic triglyceride." This is a direct statement of phytic acid's anti-fatty liver effect.

#### Sentence(s) Identified:
- "We have shown that, in addition to dietary myo-inositol, dietary phytic acid reduces excessive hepatic triglyceride."
