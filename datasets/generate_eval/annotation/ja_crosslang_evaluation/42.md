English abstract: Frame the point of RBC membrane permeability the possibility of substituting bovine for human blood in estimating mass transfer resistance of a solute was investigated theoretically and experimentally. Urea transfer through both bovine and human RBC membrane is so rapid that conventional clearance could be used. Mass transfer resistance through bovine RBC membrane doesn't allow creatinine transfer easily. Creatinine can transfer slowly through human RBC membrane within the residence time passing through a dialyzer. This difference of permeability causes the disequilibrium between inside and outside of RBC on the venus side of a dialyzer and we overestimate creatinine clearance. This clearance should not be used for estimating the removed amount of a solute.

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 牛血液と人血液 (Bovine blood and human blood)
- Relation: の物性には違いがある (There are differences in physical properties)
- Object: 物性 (Physical properties)

### English Abstract Analysis

The abstract discusses the differences in membrane permeability between bovine and human red blood cells (RBCs), specifically regarding the transfer of urea and creatinine. It states:

- "Urea transfer through both bovine and human RBC membrane is so rapid that conventional clearance could be used."
- "Mass transfer resistance through bovine RBC membrane doesn't allow creatinine transfer easily."
- "Creatinine can transfer slowly through human RBC membrane within the residence time passing through a dialyzer."
- "This difference of permeability causes the disequilibrium between inside and outside of RBC on the venus side of a dialyzer and we overestimate creatinine clearance."

These sentences clearly indicate that there are differences in the physical properties (specifically, membrane permeability) between bovine and human blood.

### Reasoning

The triple states that there are differences in the physical properties between bovine and human blood. The abstract directly discusses differences in membrane permeability (a physical property) between bovine and human RBCs, especially in the context of solute (urea and creatinine) transfer. This is a direct match to the triple.

### Score: **2** (Direct match)

### Supporting Sentences

The following sentences from the abstract directly support the triple:

1. "Mass transfer resistance through bovine RBC membrane doesn't allow creatinine transfer easily."
2. "Creatinine can transfer slowly through human RBC membrane within the residence time passing through a dialyzer."
3. "This difference of permeability causes the disequilibrium between inside and outside of RBC on the venus side of a dialyzer and we overestimate creatinine clearance."

These sentences clearly express that there are differences in the physical properties (membrane permeability) between bovine and human blood.
