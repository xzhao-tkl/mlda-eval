English abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of reperfusion therapy on the development of ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction (MI). Two hundreds twenty-eight patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) at the onset of MI were studied with Holter monitoring 1 month, 3 months and 1 year after MI. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias Lown's grade IVa≦was higher in patients with an unsuccessful PTCA (n=18) than in patients with a successful PTCA (n=210) 1 month after MI. However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias between the two groups 3 months and 1 year after MI. In the successful PTCA group, the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias Lown's grade IVa≦1 year after MI was higher in patients with a patent infarct related artery after 1 month than in patients with restenosis after 1 month. In contrast, the left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly higher and the total wall motion index measured by two-dimensional echocardiography was significantly lower in patients with ventricular arrhythmias Lown's grade IVa≦. We conclude that the development of the malignant ventricular arrhythmias after MI is dependent on the infarct size and cardiac function. Furthermore, reperfusion therapy had little effect on the inhivition of malignant ventricular arrhythmias following MI.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '心室性不整脈の出現', 'relation': 'に強く影響する因子は', 'object': '心機能と梗塞サイズ'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 心室性不整脈の出現 (Occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias)
- **Relation:** に強く影響する因子は (Strongly influencing factors are)
- **Object:** 心機能と梗塞サイズ (Cardiac function and infarct size)

### English Abstract Analysis

#### Relevant Sentences:
- "We conclude that the development of the malignant ventricular arrhythmias after MI is dependent on the infarct size and cardiac function."

#### Reasoning:
- The English abstract directly states that the development (occurrence) of malignant ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction is **dependent on** (i.e., strongly influenced by) **infarct size and cardiac function**.
- This matches the Japanese triple exactly: the factors strongly influencing the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias are cardiac function and infarct size.

### Score: **2 (Direct match)**

#### Supporting Sentence:
- "We conclude that the development of the malignant ventricular arrhythmias after MI is dependent on the infarct size and cardiac function."

### Summary:
- The knowledge triple is **directly and clearly expressed** in the English abstract. The same knowledge can be found in one sentence, making this a direct match (Score = 2).
