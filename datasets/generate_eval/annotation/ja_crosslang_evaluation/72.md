English abstract: Factors determining the SVR (sustained virological response) with PegIFN (peginterferon alfa-2b) and RBV (ribavirin) combination therapy were explored in 202 chronic hepatitis C patients (168 genotype 1 and 34 genotype 2) with high levels of circulating virus. A SVR assessed by ITT (intention-to-treat) analysis was observed in 41.1% of genotype 1 group and 76.5% of genotype 2 group. Factors influencing the SVR of genotype 1 were age, hepatic steatosis and response to prior IFN and RBV combination therapy. The SVR of genotype 1 differed significantly between the hepatic steatosis positive group (30.5%) and the negative group (61.1%) (p<0.001). The background variables influencing the presence of hepatic steatosis were FBS, IRI and HOMA-R but not BMI or lipid metabolism. The only factor influencing the SVR of genotype 2 was FBS. The SVR of genotype 2 did not differ significantly between the hepatic steatosis positive group (76.5%) and negative group (84.6%) (p=0.6725). These results seem to suggest that the hepatic steatosis is an important factor influencing the responses of genotype 1 to PegIFN and RBV combination therapy and the treatment of hepatic steatosis may be useful as a new strategy.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '1型のSVR規定因子', 'relation': 'は', 'object': '年齢、肝脂肪変性、前IFN+RBV治療効果'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 1型のSVR規定因子 (Factors determining SVR for genotype 1)
- **Relation:** は (are)
- **Object:** 年齢、肝脂肪変性、前IFN+RBV治療効果 (age, hepatic steatosis, response to prior IFN+RBV therapy)

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant sentence:
> Factors influencing the SVR of genotype 1 were age, hepatic steatosis and response to prior IFN and RBV combination therapy.

This sentence directly matches the Japanese triple, listing the same three factors (age, hepatic steatosis, response to prior IFN+RBV therapy) as determinants of SVR for genotype 1.

### Reasoning

- The subject ("Factors determining SVR for genotype 1") is directly addressed in the English abstract.
- The relation ("are") is clearly expressed.
- The object ("age, hepatic steatosis, response to prior IFN+RBV therapy") is explicitly listed in the same sentence.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence

- "Factors influencing the SVR of genotype 1 were age, hepatic steatosis and response to prior IFN and RBV combination therapy."

---

**Conclusion:**  
The Japanese triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract, with a direct sentence match.
