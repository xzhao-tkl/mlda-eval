English abstract: An extremely rare case of primary hemangiopericytoma of the chest wall is reported. A 46-year-old female was admitted to the hospital because of a right back pain. An extrapleural tumor of 2.0×2.0cm in size was detected by the chest computerized tomography (CT) scanning. The tumor was excised with a part of the 4th and 5th ribs. The pathohistological diagnosis was low-grade malignant hemangiopericytoma. Tumor cells were immunostained positively only to vimentin. The postoperative course was unevenful. The patient is now doing well as of 7 months after the operation. Hemangiopericytomy is a vascular tumor in which pericytic cells of vessel walls proliferate. It often recurs or metastasizes in spite of its benign histopathological feature. So careful follow up is important. It commonly occurs in the soft tisues of the lower extremities, especially in the thigh, perive cavity, and retroperitoneum, and rarely in the chest wall. This paper also describes a review of hemangiopericytoma arising of the chest wall seen in the Japanese literature.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '血管周皮細胞腫', 'relation': 'は発生する', 'object': '血管の周皮細胞から'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 血管周皮細胞腫 (Hemangiopericytoma)
- Relation: は発生する (arises/occurs/originates)
- Object: 血管の周皮細胞から (from pericytic cells of blood vessels)

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant sentence:
> "Hemangiopericytomy is a vascular tumor in which pericytic cells of vessel walls proliferate."

#### Reasoning
- The triple states that hemangiopericytoma arises from pericytic cells of blood vessels.
- The English abstract says hemangiopericytoma is a vascular tumor in which pericytic cells of vessel walls proliferate.
- "Proliferate" in this context means the tumor originates from these cells, matching the Japanese triple's meaning.
- The knowledge is directly expressed in one sentence.

### Score: **2** (Direct match)

#### Supporting Sentence
> "Hemangiopericytomy is a vascular tumor in which pericytic cells of vessel walls proliferate."

### Summary
The knowledge triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract. The origin of hemangiopericytoma from pericytic cells of blood vessels is explicitly stated.
