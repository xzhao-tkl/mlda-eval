English abstract: Tazobactam (TAZ) is a novel β-lactamase inhibitor. Tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC) was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity in comparison with clavulanic acid/ticarcillin (CVA/TIPC), sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC), cefoperazone (CPZ), sulbacatam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), cefotiam (CTM) and ceftazidime (CAZ). TAZ/PIPC showed 16-to 64-fold stronger activity than PIPC against TEM1 β-lactamase-producing oraganisms, and the MIC of TAZ/PIPC was smaller than those of CVA/TIPC and SBT/ABPC, and similar to that of SBT/CPZ. PIPC had poor activity against highly β-lactamase-producingBacteroides spp., but TAZ/PIPC had potent activity. The MIC90s of TAZ/PIPC were 50, 6.25, 0.10, 12.5, 6.25, 50, 0.78, 25, 50, 50, 50, 100, 6.25, 1.56, and 12.5μg/ml againstStaphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, andProvidencia rettgeri. The MIC of TAZ/PIPC was not changed under different conditions of the medium, pH, serum concentration and inoculum size. The bactericidal activity of TAZ/PIPC was stronger than that of PIPC againstS. aureus55 andE. coliTEM1 at concentations higher than 1 MIC. TAZ/PIPC showed a strong binding affinity to PBPs 2, 3 and 1 ofS. aureus209PJC, and PBPs 3, 1A and 2 ofE. coliNIHJ JC-2.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'TAZ/PIPCの抗菌力', 'relation': 'はほとんど影響を受けない', 'object': '培地の種類、培地pH、ウマ血清添加、接種菌量'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** TAZ/PIPCの抗菌力 (Antimicrobial activity of Tazobactam/Piperacillin)
- **Relation:** はほとんど影響を受けない (is hardly affected)
- **Object:** 培地の種類、培地pH、ウマ血清添加、接種菌量 (type of medium, medium pH, addition of horse serum, inoculum size)

### English Abstract
Relevant sentence:
> The MIC of TAZ/PIPC was not changed under different conditions of the medium, pH, serum concentration and inoculum size.

### Reasoning
The Japanese triple states that the antimicrobial activity of TAZ/PIPC is hardly affected by the type of medium, medium pH, addition of horse serum, and inoculum size. The English abstract directly states that the MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) of TAZ/PIPC was not changed under different conditions of the medium, pH, serum concentration, and inoculum size. This is a direct match in meaning: both say that the antimicrobial activity (as measured by MIC) is not affected by these factors.

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence(s)
- "The MIC of TAZ/PIPC was not changed under different conditions of the medium, pH, serum concentration and inoculum size."

### Conclusion
The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract.
