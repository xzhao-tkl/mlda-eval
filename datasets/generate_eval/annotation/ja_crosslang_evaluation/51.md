English abstract: There are several cases of hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation. Anesthetic agents are reported to reduce hypoxic response of the lung. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of isoflurane and propofol on oxygenation during one lung ventilation (OLV). We studied 26 patients who had OLV procedure for elective thoracic surgery, lung cancer and esophageal cancer. In 13 patients (I group) were anesthetized with isoflurane. Another 13 patients (P group) were anesthetized with propofol. The patients in both groups received thoracic epidural anesthesia with lidocaine beside general anesthesia. A double-lumen endotrachial tube was inserted, and mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen was performed. Arterial blood gases were recorded in a lateral position with two-lung ventilation, 15min, 30min, 60min after one lung ventilation. The mean value for PaO2 during OLV in P group after 15min (281.7±28.2mmHg) were significantly (p<0.05) higher than that in I group (197.9±21.1mmHg). This findings suggest that propofol is suitable for one-lung ventilation than isoflurane.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '片肺換気を必要とする麻酔時', 'relation': 'では', 'object': '術中低酸素状態をきたすことがある'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 片肺換気を必要とする麻酔時 (During anesthesia requiring one-lung ventilation)
- **Relation:** では (in/under)
- **Object:** 術中低酸素状態をきたすことがある (there can be intraoperative hypoxemia)

### English Abstract
- **Relevant Sentence:** "There are several cases of hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation."

### Reasoning
The Japanese triple states that "during anesthesia requiring one-lung ventilation, there can be intraoperative hypoxemia." The English abstract directly states, "There are several cases of hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation." This is a direct match: the same knowledge (that hypoxemia can occur during one-lung ventilation) is clearly expressed in one sentence in the abstract.

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence
- "There are several cases of hypoxemia during one-lung ventilation."

### Summary
The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract.
