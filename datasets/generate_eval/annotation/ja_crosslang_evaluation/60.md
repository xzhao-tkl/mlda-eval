English abstract: We present the surgical anatomy for a posterior approach to the craniocervical junction (CCJ). Considerable knowledge of the anatomy of the structure is mandatory before attempting surgery at the CCJ, because operating on the CCJ requires both the complexity of skull base surgery and the mobility of spinal surgery. If a surgeon attempts the CCJ surgery without this knowledge, it is not difficult to prognosticate poor results such as vertebral artery injury and induced craniocervical instability. Accordingly, we detail all of the bone, muscle, ligament, joint, artery, vein, dura and nerves involved in the posterior approach to the CCJ.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '頭蓋頸椎移行部の手術アプローチ', 'relation': 'には特に必要である', 'object': '解剖学的知識'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 頭蓋頸椎移行部の手術アプローチ (Surgical approach to the craniocervical junction)
- Relation: には特に必要である (is especially necessary for)
- Object: 解剖学的知識 (anatomical knowledge)

### English Abstract Analysis

The abstract states:
> "Considerable knowledge of the anatomy of the structure is mandatory before attempting surgery at the CCJ, because operating on the CCJ requires both the complexity of skull base surgery and the mobility of spinal surgery."

This sentence directly expresses that anatomical knowledge is especially necessary for surgical approaches to the craniocervical junction.

### Reasoning

- The subject ("surgical approach to the craniocervical junction") matches "surgery at the CCJ" in the abstract.
- The relation ("is especially necessary for") is expressed as "mandatory before attempting surgery".
- The object ("anatomical knowledge") is "knowledge of the anatomy of the structure".

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentence(s)

- "Considerable knowledge of the anatomy of the structure is mandatory before attempting surgery at the CCJ, because operating on the CCJ requires both the complexity of skull base surgery and the mobility of spinal surgery."

This sentence directly supports the triple.
