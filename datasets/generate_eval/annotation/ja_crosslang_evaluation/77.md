English abstract: Advanced carcinoma of the gallbladder can be classified by mode of infiltration into four types: Adjacent organs are involved by localized carcinoma of the liver bed type, whereas the hilar type is diffusely infiltrating carcinoma involving the liver along the bile duct at the hepatic hilus. The liver bed and hilar type of carcinoma shows a large mass involving the liver, hepatic hilus, adjacent organs and regional lymph nodes. The lymph node metastatic type has a rather small primary lesion with extended metastatic nodes involving the pancreas, duodenum and/or portal vein. Intrahepatic extension and lymph node metastasis are shown by ultrasonography and computed tomography. Duodenal involvement is demonstrated by hypotonic duodenography and endoscopic ultrasonography. Extension of cancer invasion to the bile duct can be diagnosed by selective cholangiography through transhepatic biliary drainage and percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy. Selective hepatic arteriography and percutaneous transhepatic portography are helpful for diagnosing the vessel involvement. Standard operations are hepatic segmentectomy for the liver bed type of carcinoma and extended right hepatic lobectomy with caudate lobe resection for the hepatic hilar type. Hepatopancreatoduodenectomy is indicated for extremely advanced carcinoma of the liver bed and hilar type which also involves the pancreas and duodenum, forming a large mass. The lymph node metastatic type of carcinoma requires liver bed resection for the primary lesion and extended lymphadenectomy combined with aggressive resection of the adjacent organs. Resection combined with that of the surrounding organs should be chosen not only to minimize the operative hazards but also to improve the curability.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '胆嚢癌', 'relation': 'は原発巣の位置や浸潤様式により', 'object': 'さまざまな進展を呈する'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 胆嚢癌 (Gallbladder carcinoma)
- **Relation:** は原発巣の位置や浸潤様式により (according to the location of the primary lesion and mode of infiltration)
- **Object:** さまざまな進展を呈する (shows various progression patterns / presents various developments)

### English Abstract Analysis

The abstract states:
> "Advanced carcinoma of the gallbladder can be classified by mode of infiltration into four types: ..."

It then describes how the carcinoma's progression and involvement of adjacent organs depend on the mode of infiltration and the location of the primary lesion. The abstract further details the different types of progression (liver bed type, hilar type, lymph node metastatic type, etc.), all of which are based on the location and infiltration pattern.

### Reasoning

- The Japanese triple says that gallbladder carcinoma presents various progression patterns depending on the location of the primary lesion and the mode of infiltration.
- The English abstract directly supports this by stating that advanced gallbladder carcinoma can be classified by mode of infiltration and then describes the different progression patterns/types based on this classification.

### Sentence(s) Supporting the Triple

- **First sentence:** "Advanced carcinoma of the gallbladder can be classified by mode of infiltration into four types: Adjacent organs are involved by localized carcinoma of the liver bed type, whereas the hilar type is diffusely infiltrating carcinoma involving the liver along the bile duct at the hepatic hilus."
- The subsequent sentences further elaborate on the different progression patterns based on location and infiltration.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

- The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly and clearly expressed in the first sentence of the English abstract.

### Final Answer

**Score: 2**

**Supporting sentence(s):**
- "Advanced carcinoma of the gallbladder can be classified by mode of infiltration into four types: Adjacent organs are involved by localized carcinoma of the liver bed type, whereas the hilar type is diffusely infiltrating carcinoma involving the liver along the bile duct at the hepatic hilus."
- The rest of the abstract further supports the idea that the progression depends on the location and infiltration mode.
