English abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine the pulpal response to the calcium hydroxide base Procal (3M) on human primary dental pulp. Sixteen intact primary teeth ranging between 4-9 years of age were studied in this experiment. Class 5 cavities were prepared under constant air-water coolant, using a No.35 inverted cone carbide bur rotating at high speed. Calcium hydroxide base Procal was applied to the cavity floor. Subsequently, composite resin Adaptic ( Johnson & Johnson) was placed into the cavities. The teeth were observed clinically and then removed. The teeth were processed routinely in serial sections, then stained, and evaluated microscopically. All specimens were found to be entirely asymptomatic clinically, while the histological picture shows that pulpal damages were slight except in a few cases which showed moderate change. The results of this investigation suggested that the application of Procal base under composite resin filling materials was effective for protection of the human primary dental pulp.

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 間接歯髄覆罩剤Procal (Indirect pulp capping agent Procal)
- **Relation:** はコンポジットレジンによってもたらされる歯髄の為害作用を遮断し (blocks the harmful effects on the pulp caused by composite resin)
- **Object:** 間接歯髄覆罩剤としての効果を発揮した (demonstrated effectiveness as an indirect pulp capping agent)

### English Abstract Analysis

The key points in the abstract are:
- Procal (calcium hydroxide base) was applied to the cavity floor before composite resin filling.
- The pulpal response was observed.
- All specimens were clinically asymptomatic.
- Histological examination showed slight pulpal damage, with moderate change in a few cases.
- The results suggest that Procal base under composite resin is effective for protection of the human primary dental pulp.

#### Reasoning

The Japanese triple claims that Procal, as an indirect pulp capping agent, blocks the harmful effects on the pulp caused by composite resin and demonstrates effectiveness in this role.

The English abstract supports this:
- It describes the use of Procal under composite resin.
- It reports that the teeth were clinically asymptomatic and pulpal damage was slight, suggesting protection.
- The conclusion states that Procal base under composite resin filling materials was effective for protection of the human primary dental pulp.

#### Sentence(s) Supporting the Triple

The most relevant sentence is:
> "The results of this investigation suggested that the application of Procal base under composite resin filling materials was effective for protection of the human primary dental pulp."

This directly supports the claim that Procal is effective as an indirect pulp capping agent and blocks harmful effects from composite resin.

### Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**

- The same knowledge is clearly expressed in one sentence in the abstract.

### Supporting Sentence

> "The results of this investigation suggested that the application of Procal base under composite resin filling materials was effective for protection of the human primary dental pulp."

### Summary

The Japanese triple is directly supported by the English abstract, as the effectiveness of Procal in protecting the pulp from composite resin is clearly stated.
