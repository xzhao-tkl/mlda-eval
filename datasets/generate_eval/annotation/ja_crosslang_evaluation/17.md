English abstract: Huntington’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the aggregation of mutant huntingtin (mHtt), and removal of this toxic aggregation-prone protein is expected to be an effective therapeutic approach. We designed small hybrid molecules composed of a ligand for ubiquitin ligase and probes for aggregates, anticipating that these molecules would bring the ubiquitin ligase into close proximity to mHtt, leading to degradation of mHtt by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The synthesized small molecules reduced mHtt levels in living cells. Analysis of the mode of action revealed that these small molecules induced complex formation between Htt aggregates and the ubiquitin ligase, and this led to proteasomal degradation of mHtt. Thus, we show that hijacking ubiquitin ligase induced by using small hybrid molecules could be effective therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '連結低分子', 'relation': 'は生細胞において', 'object': 'ハンチントン病原因タンパク質を減少させた'}

## Reasoning

**Japanese triple:**  
- Subject: 連結低分子 (linked small molecules / hybrid small molecules)  
- Relation: は生細胞において (in living cells)  
- Object: ハンチントン病原因タンパク質を減少させた (reduced Huntington’s disease-causing protein)

**English abstract:**  
The abstract states:  
> "The synthesized small molecules reduced mHtt levels in living cells."

This sentence directly matches the Japanese triple:
- "synthesized small molecules" = 連結低分子 (hybrid/linked small molecules)
- "reduced mHtt levels" = ハンチントン病原因タンパク質を減少させた (reduced Huntington’s disease-causing protein)
- "in living cells" = 生細胞において

## Score

**Score = 2: Direct match**  
The knowledge triple is clearly and directly expressed in one sentence in the English abstract.

## Supporting Sentence

> "The synthesized small molecules reduced mHtt levels in living cells."

## Conclusion

The Japanese triple is directly supported by the English abstract, with a clear one-to-one correspondence in a single sentence. **Score: 2**.
