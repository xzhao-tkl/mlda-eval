English abstract: Acute lower limb ischemia requires as prompt revascularization as possible.  If an irreversible change to the tissue is confirmed, a judgment concerning amputation is required.  Most cases of chronic lower limbs ischemia are arteriosclerosis obliterans.  The disease structure becomes complicated, and diabetes and dialysis cases increase the possibility of complications.  Chronic lower limb ischemia is divided into intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia, and timings of the revascularization intervention are totally different.  Intermittent claudication is given conservative treatment, and revascularization is considered when a symptom remains.  Revascularization at the earliest possible moment is necessary for critical limb ischemia.  Even if an abnormality is pointed out with a CT imaging and a ABI test value, we revascularize it but do not intervene in cases without a symptom.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '慢性下肢虚血', 'relation': 'は分類される', 'object': '間歇性破行と重症虚血肢'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 慢性下肢虚血 (Chronic lower limb ischemia)
- Relation: は分類される (is classified/divided into)
- Object: 間歇性破行と重症虚血肢 (intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia)

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant sentence:
> "Chronic lower limb ischemia is divided into intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia, and timings of the revascularization intervention are totally different."

#### Reasoning
- The English abstract directly states that "Chronic lower limb ischemia is divided into intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia."
- This matches exactly with the Japanese triple, both in subject, relation, and object.

### Score: **2** (Direct match)

#### Supporting Sentence
- "Chronic lower limb ischemia is divided into intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia, and timings of the revascularization intervention are totally different."

### Conclusion
The knowledge triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract.
