English abstract: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I allele-lacking [HLA (−)] leukocytes provide compelling evidence that cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are involved in the development of aplastic anemia (AA). However, the clinical significance and precise mechanisms underlying clonal hematopoiesis by HLA (−) hematopoietic stem progenitor cells remain unknown. In HLA (−) cells from patients with AA, we discovered a common nonsense mutation at codon19 (c.19C>T, p.R7X) in exon1 (Exon1mut) of different HLA-A and HLA-B alleles. Exon1 mutation detection using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a powerful tool for diagnosing immune pathophysiology in patients with bone marrow failure. We also looked at the prognosis of 633 patients with AA, including 127 with HLA (−) leukocytes who had been followed up for a long time. In Japanese patients with AA, HLA (−) leukocytes and concomitant aberrant clones were not associated with clonal evolution to MDS/AML. In patients with AA and both marker (−) leukocytes, HLA (−) leukocytes may indicate a lower risk of developing secondary paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Detecting HLA (−) leukocytes is critical for managing patients with AA and assisting physicians in selecting appropriate therapy.
Japanese triple: {'subject': 'ddPCRによるExon1変異の検出', 'relation': 'は重要なツールと考えられる', 'object': '骨髄不全の免疫病態の診断'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** ddPCRによるExon1変異の検出 (Detection of Exon1 mutation by ddPCR)
- **Relation:** は重要なツールと考えられる (is considered an important tool)
- **Object:** 骨髄不全の免疫病態の診断 (for diagnosis of immune pathophysiology in bone marrow failure)

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant sentence:
> Exon1 mutation detection using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a powerful tool for diagnosing immune pathophysiology in patients with bone marrow failure.

#### Reasoning
- The English abstract directly states that "Exon1 mutation detection using ddPCR is a powerful tool for diagnosing immune pathophysiology in patients with bone marrow failure."
- This matches the Japanese triple exactly: the subject (ddPCRによるExon1変異の検出), the relation (is considered an important tool), and the object (diagnosis of immune pathophysiology in bone marrow failure).
- The knowledge is expressed in a single sentence in the English abstract.

### Score: **2** (Direct match)

#### Supporting Sentence
- "Exon1 mutation detection using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a powerful tool for diagnosing immune pathophysiology in patients with bone marrow failure."

### Summary
The Japanese triple is directly and clearly supported by the English abstract, with the relevant information found in one sentence. The cross-lingual correctness score is **2**.
