English abstract: Stable and less-invasive manipulation of soft organ is a key issue in endoscopic surgeries. In previous surgeries, slipping the organ would lead some damage or the risk of rapture. It would be required especially in tissue resection. We have been developing a device for assisting the organ stably by introducing pneumatic tuning of device stiffness. In this study, we investigated shape parameters of the device structure by numerical simulation using finite elemental method. The result showed that the width of pillars and the thickness of flat part affected the rigidity gain of device and the gain reached to 11.8 in maximum. The optimized shape parameters could contribute to safe and stable operation during the surgeries.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '従来の手術', 'relation': 'では', 'object': '臓器操作中の把持力不足や滑りにより臓器損傷やダメージを引き起こす可能性が残されていた'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- **Subject:** 従来の手術 (previous surgeries)
- **Relation:** では (in)
- **Object:** 臓器操作中の把持力不足や滑りにより臓器損傷やダメージを引き起こす可能性が残されていた (there remained a possibility of organ damage or injury due to insufficient gripping force or slipping during organ manipulation)

### English Abstract
Relevant sentences:
- "Stable and less-invasive manipulation of soft organ is a key issue in endoscopic surgeries."
- "In previous surgeries, slipping the organ would lead some damage or the risk of rapture. It would be required especially in tissue resection."

### Reasoning
The Japanese triple states that in previous surgeries, insufficient gripping force or slipping during organ manipulation could cause organ damage or injury. The English abstract directly mentions that in previous surgeries, slipping the organ would lead to damage or risk of rupture, especially in tissue resection. This matches the Japanese triple's meaning: both refer to the risk of organ damage due to slipping or insufficient grip in earlier surgical methods.

### Score
**Score = 2: Direct match**

### Supporting Sentences
- "In previous surgeries, slipping the organ would lead some damage or the risk of rapture. It would be required especially in tissue resection."

This sentence directly expresses the same knowledge as the Japanese triple.

---

**Summary:**  
The knowledge in the Japanese triple is directly and clearly expressed in the English abstract. The risk of organ damage due to slipping or insufficient grip in previous surgeries is mentioned explicitly. **Score: 2 (Direct match)**.
