English abstract: Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was introduced for 7 patients (2 male, 5 female), ranging in age from 32 to 67 years. Of these 7 patients, 3 were continued on CAPD, 3 died and one transferred to hemodialysis because of repeated bouts of peritonitis. We observed 18 episodes of peritonitis among 6 of 7 patients. The diagnosis of peritonitis was based on clinical presentation of abdominal symptoms, cloudy drainage with dialysate cell counts greater than 100/mm3, finally culture for aerobic and anaerobic organisms using the culture bottle before addition of antibiotics. Most of patients, who lived close to the hospital within 30km, were admitted to the hospital as soon as possible with the cloudy drained bag. Forty-four % of cultures were only Staphylococcus epidermidis, the remainders demonstrated no growth of any organism in spite of cloudy dialysate. Frequent intraperitoneal exchange of dialysis (IPD) was introduced using the automatic cycler machine for one or two days until the drained solution became clear. Cephem antibiotics and aminoglycosides were administrated to the dialysis solution and in combination with parenteral. It is recently reported that frequent exchanges of dialysate reduce bacterial phagocytosis and antibacterial defense when the peritonitis develops. However, we obtained the useful effects on rapid improvement for abdominal distress, reduction of intraperitoneal organism and prevention of decreased ultrafiltration in peritonitis. Other complications of CAPD were related to catheter such as catheter dislocation, obstruction, spontaneous removal from the abdominal cavity, and dialysate leakage around the catheter insertion site. The latter problem was resolved by either leaving one litter of dialysate in the abdomen from the bag or converting to IPD using the automatic cycler machine. In addition to minor complications resulting from intra-abdominal pressure, there were inguinal hernia, incisional hernia, hemorrhoid with bowel constipation, hypotension, low backache and pruritus. Most of these complications were not serious enough to necessitate interruption of CAPD.
Japanese triple: {'subject': '頻回の液交換', 'relation': 'は減少させる', 'object': '白血球の食菌作用や防御因子'}

## Cross-lingual Correctness Evaluation

### Japanese Triple
- Subject: 頻回の液交換 (Frequent exchanges of dialysate)
- Relation: は減少させる (reduce/decrease)
- Object: 白血球の食菌作用や防御因子 (phagocytosis of leukocytes and defense factors)

### English Abstract Analysis

Relevant sentence:
> "It is recently reported that frequent exchanges of dialysate reduce bacterial phagocytosis and antibacterial defense when the peritonitis develops."

#### Reasoning
- The subject "frequent exchanges of dialysate" directly matches "頻回の液交換".
- The relation "reduce" matches "減少させる".
- The object "bacterial phagocytosis and antibacterial defense" is a direct translation of "白血球の食菌作用や防御因子" (phagocytosis by leukocytes and defense factors).
- The sentence explicitly states that frequent exchanges of dialysate reduce these immune functions.

### Score: **2** (Direct match)

#### Supporting Sentence
- "It is recently reported that frequent exchanges of dialysate reduce bacterial phagocytosis and antibacterial defense when the peritonitis develops."

### Conclusion
The knowledge triple is directly and clearly expressed in the English abstract.
