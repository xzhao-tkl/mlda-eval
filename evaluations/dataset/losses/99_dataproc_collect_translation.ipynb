    "1. Syntactical level\n",
    "    - Only change syntax (word order, clause structure, voice, etc.).\n",

    "    - Keep all biomedical terminology unchanged (e.g., “apoptosis”, “metastasis”, “mTOR pathway”).\n",
    "2. Lexical level\n",
    "    - Keep syntax as close as possible to the original.\n",
    "    - Replace content words (verbs, nouns, adjectives) with suitable synonyms or equivalent biomedical expressions.\n",
    "    - Maintain accuracy of biomedical terminology: Use widely accepted synonyms from standard biomedical lexicons (e.g., UMLS, MeSH, JMedTerm). Do not use informal terms for specialized concepts.\n",
    "3. Semantical level\n",
    "    - Change both syntax and vocabulary to express the same meaning in a different way.\n",

    "    - Ensure biomedical concepts remain exactly equivalent — no meaning shift, no over-generalization.\n",
    "4. Word-aligned Translation\n",
    "    - Translate into Japanese word-by-word, preserving the original sentence structure as much as possible.\n",
    "    - Retain biomedical loanwords (e.g., “apoptosis” → アポトーシス) in katakana when common in Japanese biomedical writing.\n",
    "    - Keep technical precision even if the result is less natural.\n",
    "5. Flexible Translation\n",
    "    - Translate into natural, fluent Japanese suitable for a professional biomedical paper.\n",

Semantical level\\n    - Change both syntax and vocabulary to express the same meaning in a different way.\\n    - You may merge or split clauses for clarity.\\n    - Ensure biomedical concepts remain exactly equivalent — no meaning shift, no over-generalization.\\n4. Word-aligned Translation\\n    - Translate the Japanese sentence into English word-by-word while preserving the original word order as much as possible.\\n    - Retain Japanese biomedical loanwords in transliteration when they are common in English biomedical writing.\\n    - Maintain technical precision even if the result is ungrammatical in English.\\n5. Flexible Translation\\n    - Translate into natural, fluent English suitable for a professional biomedical paper.\\n    - Reorder elements for English readability.\\n    - Replace Japanese biomedical terms with their standard English equivalents when they exist in established usage.\\n\\n### Formatting Rules\\n- Output a JSON array.\\n- Each input sentence corresponds to one JSON object with the keys:\\n    - \"original\": The original sentence in Japanese.\\n    - \"syntactical\": The syntactically modified version.\\n    - \"lexical\": The lexically modified version.\\n    - \"semantical\": The semantically modified version.\\n    - \"word_aligned_translation\": The strict translation version.\\n    - \"flexible_translation\": The flexible translation version.    \\n- Maintain the input order exactly.\\n- All output strings must be plain text without markdown formatting.\\n\\n### Input Sentences:\\n```json\\n[\\n    \"以下の文章に続けて文を追加してください。\",\\n    \"日本ではHIVの母子感染が51例報告されている。\",\\n    \"2009年には、周産期および授乳期に約37万人の子どもがHIVに感染したと国連合同エイズ計画が報告している。\",\\n    \"我々は、生まれつきHIVに感染しており、繰り返す中耳炎のため紹介された5歳の男児を診察した。\"\\n]\\n```\\n\\n### Output:\\n```json\\n[\\n    {\\n        \"original\": \"以下の文章に続けて文を追加してください。\",\\n        \"syntactical\": \"Add the following sentences to the text below.\",\\n        \"lexical\": \"Append the subsequent sentences to the following passage.\",\\n        \"semantical\": \"Please include the next sentences as a continuation of the text below.\",\\n        \"word_aligned_translation\": \"To the following text continuing sentences add please.\",\\n        \"flexible_translation\": \"Please add the following sentences to the text below.\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"original\": \"日本ではHIVの母子感染が51例報告されている。\",\\n        \"syntactical\": \"In Japan, 51 cases of mother-to-child HIV transmission have been reported.\",\\n        \"lexical\": \"Japan has documented 51 instances of vertical HIV transmission.\",\\n        \"semantical\": \"There have been 51 recorded cases in Japan where HIV was transmitted from mother to child.\",\\n        \"word_aligned_translation\": \"In Japan HIV\\'s mother-child transmission 51 cases have been reported.\",\\n        \"flexible_translation\": \"There are 51 reported cases of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Japan.\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"original\": \"2009年には、周産期および授乳期に約37万人の子どもがHIVに感染したと国連合同エイズ計画が報告している。\",\\n        \"syntactical\": \"The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS reported that about 370,000 children were infected with HIV during the perinatal and breastfeeding periods in 2009.\",\\n        \"lexical\": \"According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, approximately 370,000 children contracted HIV in the perinatal and lactation stages in 2009.\",\\n        \"semantical\": \"In 2009, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS reported that around 370,000 children became infected with HIV either at birth or while breastfeeding.\",\\n        \"word_aligned_translation\": \"In 2009, perinatal period and breastfeeding period in about 370,000 children HIV to infected that United Nations Joint AIDS Programme reports.\",\\n        \"flexible_translation\": \"In 2009, about 370,000 children became infected with HIV during the perinatal or breastfeeding periods, according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \"original\": \"我々は、生まれつきHIVに感染しており、繰り返す中耳炎のため紹介された5歳の男児を診察した。\",\\n        \"syntactical\": \"We examined a 5-year-old boy with congenital HIV infection who was referred for recurrent otitis media.\",\\n        \"lexical\": \"A 5-year-old male patient, born with HIV, was seen due to repeated middle ear infections.\",\\n        \"semantical\": \"We treated a 5-year-old boy, born HIV-positive, who had been referred because of frequent middle ear infections.\",\\n        \"word_aligned_translation\": \"We, from birth HIV to infected, recurring otitis media for referred 5 years old boy examined.\",\\n        \"flexible_translation\": \"We examined a 5-year-old boy who was born with HIV and was referred for recurrent middle ear infections.\"\\n    }\\n]\\n```\\n\\n### Input:\\n```json\\n{input}\\n```\\n\\n### Output:\\n'},\n",

      "You are an expert in biomedical natural language processing and Japanese scientific translation.\n",
      "You will be given a list of sentences, in order, from a biomedical research abstract.\n",
      "For each sentence, generate five different versions according to the following rules, while strictly preserving the biomedical meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Rules for Each Version\n",
      "1. Syntactical level\n",
      "    - Only change syntax (word order, clause structure, voice, etc.).\n",
      "    - Do not replace words with synonyms unless it is strictly required for grammaticality.\n",
      "    - Keep all biomedical terminology unchanged (e.g., “apoptosis”, “metastasis”, “mTOR pathway”).\n",
      "2. Lexical level\n",
      "    - Keep syntax as close as possible to the original.\n",
      "    - Replace content words (verbs, nouns, adjectives) with suitable synonyms or equivalent biomedical expressions.\n",
      "    - Maintain accuracy of biomedical terminology: Use widely accepted synonyms from standard biomedical lexicons (e.g., UMLS, MeSH, JMedTerm). Do not use informal terms for specialized concepts.\n",
      "3. Semantical level\n",
      "    - Change both syntax and vocabulary to express the same meaning in a different way.\n",
      "    - You may merge or split clauses for clarity.\n",
      "    - Ensure biomedical concepts remain exactly equivalent — no meaning shift, no over-generalization.\n",
      "4. Word-aligned Translation\n",
      "    - Translate into Japanese word-by-word, preserving the original sentence structure as much as possible.\n",
      "    - Retain biomedical loanwords (e.g., “apoptosis” → アポトーシス) in katakana when common in Japanese biomedical writing.\n",
      "    - Keep technical precision even if the result is less natural.\n",
      "5. Flexible Translation\n",
      "    - Translate into natural, fluent Japanese suitable for a professional biomedical paper.\n",
      "    - Reorder elements for Japanese readability.\n",
      "    - Replace foreign biomedical terms with their standard Japanese equivalents when they exist in established usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Formatting Rules\n",

      "- Each input sentence corresponds to one JSON object with the keys:\n",
